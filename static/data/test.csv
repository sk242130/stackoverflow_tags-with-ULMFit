2311,"User authentication without Session state in ASP.NET One of the requirements proposed for an ASP.NET application is that we have Session state disabled globally. (This is not negotiable.)Another requirement is that we have some means for user authentication. I'm thinking of using ASP.NET's membership provider model.Is it possible to have user authentication without Session State?The specific user-authentication examples we're looking for are:User goes to website unauthenticatedUser enters registration information (contact fields, etc)For the remainder of their session, user has access to certain content thanks to their registered statusIs there a way to do this with cookies?Can this be done securely, so the cookie can not be easily spoofed?Is there built-in functionality in ASP.NET to support this, or will we need to roll our own method?",asp.net

34954,"Can jquery manipulate a temporary document created with DOM? The thing that I want to achieve is to manipulate a document created with DOM using jquery by passing a big html string. Consider the following example:var doctype = document.implementation.createDocumentType( 'html', '', '');var dom = document.implementation.createDocument('', 'html', doctype);dom.documentElement.innerHTML = '&lt;head&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;A title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div id=""test""&gt;This is another div&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;'; This will create a new document in dom, with the content provided.

I see how the web server is pushing data but the ""Save File"" dialog doesn't come up, (or at least not in a reasonable time fashion) why?When I open the url with a WebRequest object, I see that the HttpResponse.ContentLength is ""-1"", although I can read the stream and get the file. What is the meaning of -1? When is HttpResponse.ContentLength going to show the length of the response? For example, I have a method that retrieves a big xml compresed with deflate as a binary stream, but in that case... when I access it with a WebRequest, in the HttpResponse I can actually see the ContentLength with the length of the stream, why?What is the optimal length for the Byte[] array that I use as buffer for optimal performance in a web server? I've read that is between 4K and 8K... but which factors should I consider to make the correct decision.Does this method bloat the IIS or client memory usage? or is it actually buffering the transference correctly?

42688,"Performance of NSManagedObjectContext save degrades dramatically I am having issues with a CoreData-based iOS app when it tries to build the initial DB from data sent from the server.  Basically, the server sends down 1MB chunks of objects (about 3,000 per chunk), and the iOS client deserializes them and writes them into disk.What I'm seeing is that everything is going pretty well for about the first 8 chunks (out of 44), then performance drops off dramatically and each chunk starts taking longer and longer, as in the image below.  Pretty much all the time is consumed in [NSManagedObjectContext save] as you can see in the Instruments profiling data, but also it appears that the app is no longer running at 100% of CPU for some reason, like it's waiting on disk I/O or something.A few important facts about how I'm doing this:Each chunk is processed in its own NSManagedObjectContext with its own NSAutoreleasePool, so there is no object build-up in a non-flushed context between processing of chunks.There is no NSUndoManager set on any of the contexts.There is no mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification: going on (i.e. the chunk contexts aren't pushing their changes into a ""master"" context)I'm using a SQLite-based datastore on iOS 4.3.The records being written do have indexes on them.The entire sync job is processed on a single GCD background thread (i.e. dispatch_queue_create() and dispatch_async()).I have no idea why the performance suddenly drops off like that or what can be done to address it.  I have poked around and read the following, but nothing has jumped out at me yet:http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/03/testing-core-data-with-very-big.htmlDoes the performance of saving a ManagedObjectContext depend on the number of contained (unchanged) objects?Any ideas or pointers for making this app scale up to 100,000 records in the database would be much appreciated.Edit - extra statsThis Instruments graph shows the same simulation as above (on iPad2), but includes the disk activity stats and you can see pretty plainly that all of the ""not running at 100% CPU"" time seems to be taken up with writing to disk.I also ran same sync attempt running on the iOS simulator.  Overall memory usage is more or less constant for each chunk except for a dictionary that contains object IDs that grows slightly over time (but these are not CoreData objects or anything that would affect saves, they are just NSNumbers).  This dict is a small amount of memory compared to the total heap and so the problem is not running out of memory.What is interesting about this test is that the CoreData Save instrument reports that the successive saves take roughly the same amount of time, which obviously conflicts with the CPU profiling information from the first set of results.  It seems like CoreData thinks it is taking the same amount of time to push changes to the DB, but the DB itself (i.e. SQLite) suddenly takes a lot longer to actually stream those changes to disk.",ios

I have done some research and I'd like to know whether I have a correct understanding of key handling.KeyDown/KeyUp EventThe key down and key up events are supported by IE7+ and Firefox 3.5+ I didn't check the earlier versions of the browsers, but I guess that they also support these events.Is it correct to say that each key on the keyboard will always have a keycode.CharCodeCharCode value is available on the keypress.Majority of the keys will have the charcodes that represent the actual value. Some keys won't have a charcode associated with them. E.g. backspace, delete, arrow keys. Am I correct to say that on the keypress the charcode will be the same as the keycode?Order of the eventsKeyDownKeyPressKeyUpDoes this order differ from browser to browser? For example I have two functions. First is bound to KeyDown event, second is bound to the KeyPress event. Calling a KeyPress event means that the KeyDown event will also be called, when I want only one of these events to work.Finally I have been considering on using different key handling routines depending on the version browser. For example:Check browser versionGet key handling routine depending on the browser versionThis will introduce additional code, but should simplify the maintenance. Also, in the future, when I want to provide a support for a different browser, I can simply add another routine and it won't affect existing character handling routine.So far I have been reading http://www.quirksmode.org ",javascript
40921,"How to transfer images via Bluetooth (LE) to a desktop application We are currently trying to implement the transmission of images from a mobile device (in this case an IPhone) to a desktop application. We tried already the Bluetooth Serial plugin which works fine for Android but does not list any devices when scanning for our desktop application.To cover iOS support (AFAIK iOS only supports BluetoothLE), we reimplemented our desktop application to use BluetoothLE and behave like a peripheral. Also we altered our Ionic application to use BLE plugin.Now BluetoothLE only supports the transmission of packages with the size of 20 Byte whilst our image is about 500kb big. So we could obviously split our image into chunks and transmit it with the following function (taken from this gist):function writeLargeData(buffer) {    console.log('writeLargeData', buffer.byteLength, 'bytes in',MAX_DATA_SEND_SIZE, 'byte chunks.');    var chunkCount = Math.ceil(buffer.byteLength / MAX_DATA_SEND_SIZE);    var chunkTotal = chunkCount;    var index = 0;    var startTime = new Date();    var transferComplete = function () {        console.log(""Transfer Complete"");    }    var sendChunk = function () {        if (!chunkCount) {            transferComplete();            return; // so we don't send an empty buffer        }        console.log('Sending data chunk', chunkCount + '.');        var chunk = buffer.slice(index, index + MAX_DATA_SEND_SIZE);        index += MAX_DATA_SEND_SIZE;        chunkCount--;        ble.write(            device_id,             service_uuid,             characteristic_uuid,             chunk,             sendChunk,         // success callback - call sendChunk() (recursive)            function(reason) { // error callback                console.log('Write failed ' + reason);            }        )    }    // send the first chunk    sendChunk();}Still this would mean for us that we would have to launch about 25k transmissions which I assume will take a long time to complete. Now I wonder why is that the data transmission via Bluetooth is that handicapped.",ios

19817,"Can't Use ""Vendored Framework"" CocoaPod Inside Workspace Playground I've created a sample project illustrating my issue here.In summary, I'm trying to use a ""vendored framework"" CocoaPod inside a workspace playground. I think this is possible but requires a bit of fiddling with project settings, and I can't quite figure out what to change.To observe the issue in the sample project, do the following:Open CocoaPods-Test/CocoaPods-Test.xcworkspace in Xcode.Pods should be installed and committed in the repository, but can run pod install if necessary.Note that the CocoaPods-Test target builds and runs successfully, importing PromiseKit and TwilioChatClient pods.Navigate to Playground.playground within the workspace. Note that the playground executes fine while importing PromiseKit but if TwilioChatClient is imported, playground execution fails with ""no such module 'TwilioChatClient'"".After reading the following resources:https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/5334https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/5215https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/5563https://github.com/CocoaPods/swift/issues/3https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/4135https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/2240https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/6669#issuecomment-300188519https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/troubleshooting.htmlhttps://www.objc.io/issues/6-build-tools/cocoapods-under-the-hood/I think the issue is probably related to the fact that TwilioChatClient is a ""vendored framework"" (see its podspec), which means a pod target is not created for it. After reading the above resources, I feel like a solution is within reach, but I can't quite figure it out.While the sample project here illustrates what I think is the underlying issue, the issue that prompted me to create this example project is just a small bit more complicated. In my project, I create a framework target containing all my app's code (so it can be imported into my app and also into my playgrounds using app resources). This framework then has pod dependencies, including PromiseKit and TwilioChatClient. The execution error in the playground is different (""Couldn't lookup symbols"" instead of ""no such module""), as I am not importing the CocoaPods module directly but my framework which uses the pod framework.I suspect if I can solve the ""no such module"" issue, it will help me solve my ""couldn't lookup symbols"" issue.Finally, this seems like a good opportunity to make an open source contribution others don't seem to have wanted to do (see discussion here). Tangentially, I'd love to contribute but just don't feel like I understand what exactly is going on with CocoaPods, the Xcode build process, etc., after reading about it a bit (e.g. here and here). Any references to help understand the Xcode build process and what CocoaPods is doing under the hood are appreciated. It seems like the resources I've found are either ""a very high level overview"" (which I get), or ""digging through the source code"", with not a whole lot in between.",ios

Target systems are basically iOS, Windows Phone 7.5 and Windows 8. In the first step it's going to be a local wireless LAN application. There are existing servers (using .net / WCF) that have all the data I want to display. The app will be polling every few seconds and give a live view on the data. I won't be accessing the data server directly but have to create my own app-server in between.For the client I chose the HTML5, CSS, JavaScript (JQuery) approach to make it run in any modern browser. So I'll have to communicate via http.My question is which technologie to use for the server side of my app. I have to receive http requests, get data (at best via WCF) from another server and send it to the client as xml or html. (I am not quite sure whether server or client has to convert xml data into html)Searching the web I figured out two possible approaches:ASP.netBuilding my own simple http server using WCFLooking at some ASP.net documentation and examples I got the impression that it just works the way I know from PHP etc... (Client sends request, server runs a script/programm, server sends response, programm terminates) I cannot keep objects in memory and run code independent of client requests. Or at least it's not designed to work like that. Is that correct?That would force me to build my own very simple server that can answer a few specific http requests.So my questions are:Are my assumptions about ASP.net correct?

30827,"AuthenticateRequest event Q 1. To my understanding FormsAuthenticationModule is subscribed to AuthenticateRequest event, and thus only after this event is fired, is FormsAuthenticationModule called. But the following quotes got me a bit confused:  The AuthenticateRequest event signals that the configured authentication mechanism has authenticated the current request.Doesn’t the above quote suggest that when AuthenticateRequest event is raised, request (aka user) is already authenticated?    Subscribing to the AuthenticateRequest event ensures that the request will be authenticated before processing the attached module or event handler.As far as I understand this quote, if we subscribe to AuthenticatedRequest, then our event handler will be called prior to FormsAuthenticationModule? Thus Application_AuthenticateRequest() will be called before FormsAuthenticationModule is called?Q 2. Book I’m learning from suggests that within Application_AuthenticateRequest() we are able to verify whether user is a member of specific role, and if not, we can add the user automatically:    protected void Application_AuthenticateRequest(Object sender, EventArgs e)    {            if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated &amp;&amp; Roles.Enabled)            {                //here we can subscribe user to a role via Roles.AddUserToRole()            }           }Judging from the above code, Application_AuthenticateRequest() is called after FormsAuthenticationModule has been invoked,  but somewhere else same book implies that Application_AuthenticateRequest() is called prior to FormsAuthenticationModule:      Application_AuthenticateRequest  is called just before authentication is performed.    This is a jumping-off point for creating your own authentication logic.  What am I missing?Thanx","c#,asp.net"

In client side I wouldn't have any problem by getting it through javascript document object but the problem lies server side.I thought about making available in the Redux store the Node.js environment data kept in this config.js file, where hostname is kept// Node.js environment file config.js    require('babel-polyfill');const environment = {   development: {    isProduction: false  },    production: {    isProduction: true  }}[process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'];module.exports = Object.assign({  host: process.env.HOST || 'localhost',  port: process.env.PORT,  apiHost: process.env.APIHOST || 'localhost',  apiPort: process.env.APIPORT}, environment);and with the location object of React Router set as props in the component get the pathname and fully construct the URL.What I have done is to create a simple reducer with an initial state to keep the Node.js config enviroment data and just the default action to include in my combineReducers function with the other app reducers.const initialState = {   config: {}};export default function config(state = initialState, action = {}) {  switch (action.type) {    default:      return state;  }}And then I injected the Node.js object with the environment data in the creation of the store, as initial state data, in my server.js file.import config from './config';...const store = createStore(memoryHistory, client, {config});...Thus I have available the hostname and I am able in the component to construct its full url both client and server side through Redux store.But, is there any simpler / cleanest way?

33043,"Using Core Data Concurrently and Reliably I'm building my first iOS app, which in theory should be pretty straightforward but I'm having difficulty making it sufficiently bulletproof for me to feel confident submitting it to the App Store.Briefly, the main screen has a table view, upon selecting a row it segues to another table view that displays information relevant for the selected row in a master-detail fashion. The underlying data is retrieved as JSON data from a web service once a day and then cached in a Core Data store. The data previous to that day is deleted to stop the SQLite database file from growing indefinitely. All data persistence operations are performed using Core Data, with  an NSFetchedResultsController underpinning the detail table view.The problem I am seeing is that if you switch quickly between the master and detail screens several times whilst fresh data is being retrieved, parsed and saved, the app freezes or crashes completely. There seems to be some sort of race condition, maybe due to Core Data importing data in the background whilst the main thread is trying to perform a fetch, but I'm speculating. I've had trouble capturing any meaningful crash information, usually it's a SIGSEGV deep in the Core Data stack.The table below shows the actual order of events that happen when the detail table view controller is loaded:Main Thread                          Background ThreadviewDidLoad                                     Get JSON data (using AFNetworking)Create child NSManagedObjectContext (MOC)                                     Parse JSON data                                     Insert managed objects in child MOC                                     Save child MOC                                     Post import completion notificationReceive import completion notificationSave parent MOCPerform fetch and reload table view                                     Delete old managed objects in child MOC                                     Save child MOC                                     Post deletion completion notificationReceive deletion completion notificationSave parent MOCOnce the AFNetworking completion block is triggered when the JSON data has arrived, a nested NSManagedObjectContext is created and passed to an ""importer"" object that parses the JSON data and saves the objects to the Core Data store. The importer executes using the new performBlock method introduced in iOS 5:NSManagedObjectContext *child = [[NSManagedObjectContext alloc] initWithConcurrencyType:NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType];    [child setParentContext:self.managedObjectContext];            [child performBlock:^{        // Create importer instance, passing it the child MOC...    }];The importer object observes its own MOC's NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification and then posts its own notification which is observed by the detail table view controller. When this notification is posted the table view controller performs a save on its own (parent) MOC. I use the same basic pattern with a ""deleter"" object for deleting the old data after the new data for the day has been imported. This occurs asynchronously after the new data has been fetched by the fetched results controller and the detail table view has been reloaded.One thing I am not doing is observing any merge notifications or locking any of the managed object contexts or the persistent store coordinator. Is this something I should be doing? I'm a bit unsure how to architect this all correctly so would appreciate any advice.",ios

The key performance measurements are:170 ms: a blank window appears on the screen2800 ms: the window shows the specified HTMLAfter asking about it, I discovered that the problem is caused by Windows Defender. Disabling its real-time protection gets us an acceptable startup speed:150 ms: a blank window appears on the screen500 ms: the window shows the specified HTMLWhile this speedup solves the problem completely, it is a no-go to ask users to disable Windows Defender in order to have faster startup.QuestionI have observed some popular Electron apps, like Visual Studio Code, have normal startup time so I assume there is a way to achieve that without disabling Windows Defender. The question is: how?The only thing that comes to my mind is signing the electron binary, in the hope that it solves the problem.

32196,"Should I be worried about rumors that Apple will stop using Google Maps in iOS6? Almost every major news media outlet is reporting that Apple will stop using Google Maps services in iOS6. I don't think anyone really knows what exactly the changes are, when they will be rolled out, how Apple will implement them and if Google or Apple will start charging money for their services. As a result of these uncertainties, I am having trouble making a sound decision on whether I should or should not release a new public bus tracker app that I have been working on for over a year now. I have had the initial hard deadline set for June 15, 2012. I know that the best thing to do is to wait and see what the changes will be and how Apple will implement them. But I am a bit impatient and stressed out about pushing the release date as any further delay will affect many of my other plans in a very significant way. More information on the app:It provides real time public transit information based on information it obtains from a third-party transit agency's API. It heavily depends on the iOS MapKit framework and iOS location services to display current geolocation of buses on a given route in realtime and to provide transit information between two locations. According to Apple, the iOS MapKit framework uses Google services to provide map data. Some features invoke the Google Maps app to provide transit planning and turn-by-turn directions to nearest stops. My question:If the rumors turn out to be true, do you think Apple will most certainly implement any changes without affecting apps that already use the current MapKit framework?  What kinds of potential problems should I be prepared for? ",ios

I want to add a request header to ALL outgoing requests (html, images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) within this WKWebView. I can't find out how to do this.Background:I've got a Swift iOS application which uses a WKWebView to render it's html views. These views are hosted on our servers, which is divided into a production environment and an staging environment. I've set up the staging environment using Akamai so that all incoming request musts pass along a request header in order for the request to get accepted.The issue:Currently, I've created a subclass of WKWebView which overrides the loadRequest method, which looks something like this:override func loadRequest(request: NSURLRequest) -&gt; WKNavigation? {    guard let mutableRequest = request.mutableCopy() as? NSMutableURLRequest else {        return super.loadRequest(request)    }    if let url = request.URL, host = url.host {        if (host == ""staging.example.com"") {            mutableRequest.setValue(""secret-value"", forHTTPHeaderField: ""secret-header"")        }    }    return super.loadRequest(mutableRequest)}This catches the initial html request, which works as expected. However, since this page in it's turn loads both images, stylesheets and scripts from the same server, these does not go through the loadRequest method and gets denied because their request lack this required request header.Requirements:It has got to work with WKWebView on iOS 8+.",ios

25828,"Qt mobile video call streaming I’m completely new to Qt mobile, I even don’t have a solid mobile dev experience, so sorry if I’m asking something obvious.I need to develop a mobile app that should have the ability to receive a call like functionality (over internet, not GSM call). When answered, it should start streaming audio and video from our server. The call should be one way only, meaning, that stream goes from server to device, but never from device to server.So my questions is:Is this possible in Qt? I chose Qt because I’ familiar with it and I want to support desktop, android and ios. maybe windows phone later.Is it possible to receive a call when the screen is shut off and my app is not running? I mean, this is a mobile device, the app won't be running all the time, it should be started only when a call is made from server to device. How can I achieve that? I think Viber, Skype and other messaging apps do that.Many thanks in advance :)",ios
23011,"Swift SpriteKit PhysicsBody forced as optional by Xcode im having the following issue trying to code a flappy birds clone in Xcode 6 beta 7 with Swift and SpriteKit.After I add the physicsBody property to a SKSpriteNode I cannot change a property of physicsBody directly, for instance I cannot do the following:bird = SKSpriteNode(texture: birdTexture1)bird.position = CGPoint(x: self.frame.size.width / 2.8, y: CGRectGetMidY(self.frame))bird.runAction(flight)bird.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: bird.size.height/2)bird.physicsBody.dynamic = truebird.physicsBody.allowsRotation = falseXcode build will fail with errors on the two lines where i add dynamic and allowsRotation values to PhysicsBody, the only way I can do it is by doing the following:bird.physicsBody?.dynamic = truebird.physicsBody?.allowsRotation = falseThe issue of having physicsBody as optional with the '?' character is that it makes it complicated to do certain operations when trying to manipulate some bird physics I wanted to add, like rotation when moving.Any suggestion on how to avoid / fix having to mark the physicsBody property as optional?

17287,"AVPlayer HLS live stream level meter (Display FFT Data) I'm using AVPlayer for a radio app using HTTP live streaming. Now I want to implement a level meter for that audio stream. The very best would a level meter showing the different frequencies, but a simple left / right solution would be a great starting point.I found several examples using AVAudioPlayer. But I cannot find a solution for getting the required informations off AVPlayer.Can someone think of a solution for my problem?EDIT I want to create something like this (but nicer)EDIT IIOne suggestion was to use MTAudioProcessingTap to get the raw audio data. The examples I could find using the [[[_player currentItem] asset] tracks] array, which is, in my case, an empty array. Another suggestion was to use [[_player currentItem] audioMix] which is null for me.EDIT IIIAfter years already, there still not seems to be a solution.

32742,"iOS 11 safe areas vs. UIView animation Consider the following: I've made a reusable UIView subclass which has a background, and some content laid out in its subviews. As the responsible developer I am, I've aligned the view's subviews based on its safe area, so that it will automatically inset its contents when necessary (e.g. on iPhone X):Excellent! The inner view goes edge-to-edge when it's inside the safe area, and insets its content from the bottom when it hangs out of the safe area. Now let's say that initially the view should be off-screen, but when the user taps somewhere in my app, I want my view to animate to the center of the screen, and it should animate out on a second tap. Let's implement it like this:@implementation ViewController {    UIView* _view;}- (void)viewDidLoad {    [super viewDidLoad];    [self.view addGestureRecognizer:[[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(animate:)]];}- (void)animate:(UITapGestureRecognizer*)sender {    if (_view == nil) {        _view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100)];        _view.backgroundColor = UIColor.redColor;        UIView* innerView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(5, 5, 90, 90)];        innerView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = NO;        innerView.backgroundColor = UIColor.blueColor;        [_view addSubview:innerView];        [_view addConstraints:@[[_view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.topAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:innerView.topAnchor constant:-5],                                [_view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.rightAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:innerView.rightAnchor constant:5],                                [_view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.bottomAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:innerView.bottomAnchor constant:5],                                [_view.safeAreaLayoutGuide.leftAnchor constraintEqualToAnchor:innerView.leftAnchor constant:-5]]];        _view.center = CGPointMake(self.view.bounds.size.width / 2,                                   self.view.bounds.size.height + _view.bounds.size.height / 2);        [self.view addSubview:_view];        [UIView animateWithDuration:1 animations:^{            _view.center = CGPointMake(self.view.bounds.size.width / 2,                                       self.view.bounds.size.height / 2);        }];    } else {        [UIView animateWithDuration:1 animations:^{            _view.center = CGPointMake(self.view.bounds.size.width / 2,                                       self.view.bounds.size.height + _view.bounds.size.height / 2);        } completion:^(BOOL finished) {            [_view removeFromSuperview];            _view = nil;        }];    }}@endSo, now if we launch the app and tap on the screen, this happens:So far so good. However, this is what happens when we tap it again:As you can see, even though the view goes completely outside of the superview's bounds, the safe area insets still get set as if it was at the bottom of its superview. We can make the effect less abrupt by calling [self.view layoutIfNeeded] in the animation block in which the view is animated out, but it doesn't eliminate the problem – the bottom space will just grow in an animated fashion instead of expanding abruptly:This is still not acceptable for me. I want it to slide out exactly like it slid in, with 5pt padding on all sides.

3537,"Cross-browser implementation of ""HTTP Streaming"" (push) AJAX pattern Client request web page from server. Clent then requests for extra calculations to be done; server performs series of calculations and sends partial results as soon as they are available (text format, each line contains separate full item). Client updates web page (with JavaScript and DOM) using information provided by server.This seems to fit HTTP Streaming (current version) pattern from Ajaxpatterns site.The question is how to do it in cross-browser (browser agnostic) way, preferably without using JavaScript frameworks, or using some lightweight framework like jQuery. The problem begins with generating XMLHttpRequest in cross-browser fashion, but I think the main item is that not all browsers implement correctly onreadystatechangefrom XMLHttpRequest; not all browsers call onreadystatechange event on each server flush (BTW. how to force server flush from within CGI script (in Perl)?). Example code on Ajaxpatterns deals with this by using timer; should I drop timer solution if I detect partial response from onreadystatechange?Added 11-08-2009Current solution:I use the following function to create XMLHttpRequest object:function createRequestObject() {        var ro;        if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {                ro = new XMLHttpRequest();        } else {                ro = new ActiveXObject(""Microsoft.XMLHTTP"");        }        if (!ro)                debug(""Couldn't start XMLHttpRequest object"");        return ro;}If I were to use some (preferably light-weight) JavaScript framework like jQuery, I'd like to have fallback if user chooses not to install jQuery.I use the following code to start AJAX; setInterval is used because some browsers call onreadystatechange only after server closes connection (which can take as long as tens of seconds), and not as soon as server flushes data (around every second or more often).function startProcess(dataUrl) {        http = createRequestObject();        http.open('get', dataUrl);        http.onreadystatechange = handleResponse;        http.send(null);        pollTimer = setInterval(handleResponse, 1000);}The handleResponse function is most complicated one, but the sketch of it looks like the following. Can it be done better? How it would be done using some lightweight JavaScript framework (like jQuery)?function handleResponse() {    if (http.readyState != 4 &amp;&amp; http.readyState != 3)        return;    if (http.readyState == 3 &amp;&amp; http.status != 200)        return;    if (http.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; http.status != 200) {        clearInterval(pollTimer);        inProgress = false;    }    // In konqueror http.responseText is sometimes null here...    if (http.responseText === null)        return;    while (prevDataLength != http.responseText.length) {        if (http.readyState == 4  &amp;&amp; prevDataLength == http.responseText.length)            break;        prevDataLength = http.responseText.length;        var response = http.responseText.substring(nextLine);        var lines = response.split('\n');        nextLine = nextLine + response.lastIndexOf('\n') + 1;        if (response[response.length-1] != '\n')            lines.pop();        for (var i = 0; i &lt; lines.length; i++) {            // ...        }    }    if (http.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; prevDataLength == http.responseText.length)        clearInterval(pollTimer);    inProgress = false;}",javascript

26860,"How to call scrollViewDidScroll: the same way UIScrollView does, but during custom animation? I have a very large horizontally scrolling UIScrollView which is reusing its subviews (moves and updates them when they are out of visible area, similar like UITableView is reusing cells). This relies on scrollViewDidScroll: delegate call, which gives me actual contentOffset, and here I decide when to reuse particular subview. So far so good.Sometimes I need to change contentOffset programatically, but with custom animation (inertia and bounce back to the final position). I can do this quite easily using core animation.The problem is, that during custom animation scrollViewDidScroll: delegate method is not called -> I must do it manually so that subviews reusing works. I tried to call it with timer firing each 0.02 sec. Now there are two problems:I must get UIScrollView contentOffset using [[_scrollView.layer presentationLayer] bounds].origin.x because during animation normal _scrollView.contentOffset does not change.However info from presentationLayer is not sufficient for exact syncing - sometimes it is bit late.problem is when the new contentOffset is far from current position. It looks like built-in UIScrollView animation is CAKeyframeAnimation, and scrollViewDidScroll should is called on key frames positions. But I am not able to get these. If I rely on timer which is not synced with key frames, views are reused on wrong places and I can not see them at all during animation.Can anyone shed some light on how and when exactly UIScrollView calls scrollViewDidScroll during setContentOffset:X animated:YES?

17654,"Direct vs. Delegated - jQuery .on() I am trying to understand this particular difference between the direct and delegated event handlers using the jQuery .on() method. Specifically, the last sentence in this paragraph:  When a selector is provided, the event handler is referred to as delegated. The handler is not called when the event occurs directly on the bound element, but only for descendants (inner elements) that match the selector. jQuery bubbles the event from the event target up to the element where the handler is attached (i.e., innermost to outermost element) and runs the handler for any elements along that path matching the selector.What does it mean by ""runs the handler for any elements""? I made a test page to experiment with the concept. But both following constructs lead to the same behavior:$(""div#target span.green"").on(""click"", function() {   alert($(this).attr(""class"") + "" is clicked"");});or,$(""div#target"").on(""click"", ""span.green"", function() {   alert($(this).attr(""class"") + "" is clicked"");});Maybe someone could refer to a different example to clarify this point?

20236,"AngularJS: Best way to watch dimensions? So, I've come up with a few solutions to this and I'm still not quite sure what is best.  First for reference there is one similar question I could find, though it's a bit old.  Here it is for anyone reading this later: Watching dimension changes in AngularThe GoalI have portions of my app in which responsive height elements are needed.  I want the fastest, most visually appealing way to do this at the UI/directive layer without the need of explicitly broadcasted change events.Option One: DirectiveA simple directive can record the dimensions on every digest loop (and resize event)return {  scope: {    size: '=ngSize'  },  link: function($scope, element, attrs) {    var windowEl = angular.element($window),        handler  = function() {          if ($scope.size &amp;&amp;              element.outerWidth() === $scope.size.width &amp;&amp;              element.outerHeight() === $scope.size.height) return false;          $scope.size = {            width: element.outerWidth(),            height: element.outerHeight()          };        };    windowEl.on('resize', function() {      $scope.$apply(handler);    });    $root.$watch(function() { return [element.outerWidth(), element.outerHeight()] }, handler, true);  }};Problem: The change doesn't propagate quickly enough and visual lag is noticeable.Solution: Using an interval callOption Two: $intervalI tried the same thing with an $interval call and it worked, but CPU usage was surprisingly high, even after I inverted control and kept track of elements in a simple root collection watched by value (avoiding concurrent timers produced by multiple instances of the directive).Aside from some GC-related issue in my environment (I don't see anything that suggests this currently), might there be a better approach to creating this kind of fluid layout?Proposed Solution/QuestionMy first thought would be a way to create a concurrent $digest loop of sorts, to efficiently monitor the DOM as a whole for any visual changes.  Is it possible to efficiently iterate through all computed styles, for example, to produce a cheap hash that can be watched by value?  Something that can be triggered relatively inexpensively every time a relevant computed style is added and/or changed?Before I build and profile it, could someone comment as to whether it's even realistic, or if it simply makes more sense to abstract/refactor the resize triggers in the first place?Any other ideas on the preferred way to accomplish this in 1.2.9?[edit] An alternate, perhaps simpler question: is it even possible to provide a realistic refresh rate of 1-200ms via Javascript in a computationally-efficient manner?  If so, would that way be Angular's $interval, or could a 'VanillaJS' implementation be more efficient?",javascript

Compare the behavior when using the two buttons.$scope.items.push( $scope.items.shift() );Here's another demo of an alternative approach, where the transitions work, but the array loses an element each time the function runs. $scope.items.shift( $scope.items.push() );The idea is that the user can cycle through the items in the array indefinitely and the CSS transitions occur in both directions. What seems to be the issue is that AngularJS updates the DOM in one case, but not in the other, though I wasn't able to demonstrate that in my testing. Also, based on some reading I did I tried using track by item.id with no success. Thanks much.",javascript

I created my cache object as a singleton pattern with a static method to update the cache which is really just loading a member variable/property with a collection of data i need cached (got some locking logic ofcourse). I figured it was a nice way to go since i can just access my data by calling MyCacheObject.Instance.MyDataCollectionI'm creating a new cache object to store a pretty big amount of data partitioned by some key.

Since i'm storing a huge amount of data, wouldn't it be a waste if it got gc'ed all of a sudden?

28957,"Architecture for login system on MEAN stack? I'm developing a web app on the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and node.js). I'm developing a login system, and will also have some of the Angular routes protected so that only logged-in users can access them. I'm trying to think of the best way to approach the architecture of this.I'm thinking of the current workflow:User logs in via AngularJS form, which sends an http POST to an Express endpoint. The endpoint validates the user against the database, and responds with an OAuth token as well as a cookie. Both are stored in the mongo database for later validation.Once AngularJS receives the login response, it stores the received cookie using ng-cookies, and stores the OAuth token in a User service.Every time the route changes in AngularJS now, the User service is used to make sure that the cookie is still legitimate by comparing it to cookies in the mongo database (this would be an API call using Angular's resolve... would this create a noticeable lag?)When a user clicks ""log out"" or the cookie expires, the cookie and OAuth token are both deleted from the database and will no longer be valid.Does this approach make sense?

41858,"Why publish the TypeScript declaration file on DefinitelyTyped for a Javascript library? I published two Javascript libraries on npm and users have asked for TypeScript type definitions for both of them. I don't use TypeScript myself and I have no plans to rewrite those libraries in TypeScript, but I'd still like to add the type definition files if only for better IntelliSense code completion. I'm looking for some advice with this.I started with reading the docs of the DefinitelyTyped project and the documentation on publishing a declaration file for an npm package. Both sources state that &quot;publishing to the @types organization on npm&quot; is the preferred approach for projects not written in TypeScript.Why is that preferred over publishing type definitions alongside the library itself via the types field in package.json? I really don't see the point in involving a third party in this. It seems like updating the type definitions and versioning them is just more complicated this way.Quotes from the documentation referenced above (emphasis mine)From DefinitelyTyped:If you are the library author and your package is written in TypeScript, bundle the autogenerated declaration files in your package instead of publishing to Definitely Typed.From typescriptlang.org:Now that you have authored a declaration file following the steps of this guide, it is time to publish it to npm. There are two main ways you can publish your declaration files to npm:bundling with your npm package, orpublishing to the @types organization on npm.If your package is written in TypeScript then the first approach is favored. Use the --declaration flag to generate declaration files. This way, your declarations and JavaScript will always be in sync.If your package is not written in TypeScript then the second is the preferred approach.Both seem to say:if (isAuthor &amp;&amp; lang === &quot;typescript&quot;)  bundle();else  publishOnDefinitelyTyped();",javascript

14499,"WAI-ARIA: Javascript Capability Testing? In the spirit of progressive enhancement, I'd like to do some ARIA capabilities testing to implement additional enhancements if they're supported by the browser. I'm not looking to detect screen readers—I'm looking to ensure that screen reader users will get the optimal experience given the tools that they're using. For example, if the aria-live attribute is not supported, then it may not be a good idea to implement endless scrolling.I'm aware that there's an additional concern that browsers may support these attributes but the screen reader may not. Since screen readers run transparently over browsers, I'm okay with that edge case being ignored.I've never heard of anyone doing anything like this. Is it as easy as testing for additional DOM properties endowed by browsers? Do one of Mark Pilgrim's other capability testing techniques work here?Thanks!",javascript

32522,"InputAccessoryView docked at bottom I'm trying to achieve similar positioning behavior as the bottom text input bar in Apple's Messages app.I have tried many approaches, searched high and low and there are many similar questions but none have been satisfactory.To specify:There is a UIToolbar at the bottom of the viewThe toolbar is to follow the keyboard as the keyboard appears and disappearsThe toolbar should stay on top of the keyboard when the keyboard is visibleWhen the keyboard is hidden, the toolbar stays (""docked"") at the bottom of the viewThe proposed solutions:Manually animate the toolbar in response to keyboard appearance notificationsThis solution does not meet a special case of the second requirement (the toolbar is to follow the keyboard as the keyboard appears and disappears):In iOS 7, UIScrollViewKeyboardDismissMode was introduced. It enables an interactive gesture for dismissing the keyboard. As the the user pans past the top edge of the keyboard, the keyboard frame gradually follows. This solution does nothing to accomodate this behavior and just leaves the toolbar stranded at it's animated position.In addition, this solution also fails to fulfil a special case of the third requirement (the toolbar should stay on top of the keyboard when the keyboard is visible):Rotation. This solution calls for additional, annoyingly extraneous code (as we will see in the next proposed solution) to rotate the toolbar in response to device rotation.Another issue with this solution:Keyboard height. With this solution, the toolbar it is not assumed to be part of the height of the keyboard, so additional code must be written to support proper insetting of content.Next proposed solution:Use UIResponder's inputAccessoryViewThis solution seems to be the way Apple intended to support this kind of behavior, as it solves all the shortcomings of manually animating the toolbar. But this solution completely misses the fourth requirement (when the keyboard is hidden, the toolbar stays (""docked"") at the bottom of the view).It seems the solution is to use UIResponder's inputAccessoryView, but somehow making the inputAccessoryView not move below the view. I'm looking for clean code to accomplish this. There are elaborate, almost noble, attempts elsewhere, but as mentioned, they do not meet the requirements.In my particular case, I am looking to use UINavigationController's toolbar which entails additional issues as this is not intended behavior for UINavigationController.

17107,"Something wrong with javascript unsigned shift operator on iPad? I accidentally ran into what appears to be a very strange bug in Safari's javascript engine on iPad.The unsigned shift operator >>> is supposed to bitwise right-shift a number.

Obviously the >>> 0 is meaningless here (a shift over zero places typically does nothing, although it could have forced an integer to become unsigned if javascript made that distinction). It's just to demonstrate the problem, if you omit the >>> 0 it doesn't show up. In my actual situation there were different numbers and more complex expressions involved, but the same thing happened: everything works until a number of iterations, then something 'breaks' and variables suddenly become and remain zero, even after subsequent calculations that really ought to make them non-zero.Works fine on Android and PC browsers.

40311,"ASP.NET C#5 Asynchronous Web Applications Using Async & Await Having researched the concept of asynchronous web development, specifically from this source, I created a sample application to prove the concept.The solution is composed of 2 ASP.NET Web API applications. The first is a simulated slow endpoint; it waits for 1000 ms before returning a list a custom class called Student: public IEnumerable&lt;Student&gt; Get()    {        Thread.Sleep(1000);        return new List&lt;Student&gt; { new Student { Name = @""Paul"" }, new Student { Name = @""Steve"" }, new Student { Name = @""Dave"" }, new Student { Name = @""Sue"" } };    }Here is the Student class:public class Student{    public string Name { get; set; }}This endpoint is hosted in IIS 7 on localhost:4002.The second application contacts the first using 2 endpoints, one synchronous, the other asynchronous:public IEnumerable&lt;Student&gt; Get() {        var proxy = WebRequest.Create(@""http://localhost:4002/api/values"");        var response = proxy.GetResponse();        var reader = new StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream());        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Student&gt;&gt;(reader.ReadToEnd());    }    public async Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Student&gt;&gt; Get(int id) {        var proxy = new HttpClient();        var getStudents = proxy.GetStreamAsync(@""http://localhost:4002/api/values"");        var stream = await getStudents;        var reader = new StreamReader(stream);        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;IEnumerable&lt;Student&gt;&gt;(reader.ReadToEnd());    }It's hosted in IIS 7 on localhost:4001.Both endpoints work as expected, and return in approx. 1 second. Based on the video in the link above at 13:25, the asynchronous method should release it's Thread, minimizing contention.I'm running performance tests on the application using Apache Bench. Here are the response times for the synchronous method with 10 concurrent requests:This is much as I'd expect; more concurrent connections increase contention and extend the response times. However, here are the asynchronous response times:As you can see, there still seems to be some contention. I would have expected the average response times to be more balanced. If I run the tests on both endpoints with 50 concurrent requests, I still get similar results.Based on this, it seems that both asynchronous and synchronous methods are running at more or less the same speed (expected), not taking into account the overhead in asynchronous methods, but also that the asynchronous method doesn't seem to be releasing Threads back to the ThreadPool. I'd welcome any comments or clarifications, thanks.","c#,asp.net"

I have created subclassed buttons that arrange the image and the title vertically centred above each other and enable the user to set a border width and color through IB with IBInspectable.The following warning is logged and there is no preview available of my code in drawRect:warning: IB Designables: Ignoring user defined runtime attribute for key path ""spacingBetweenLabelAndImage"" on instance of ""UIButton"". Hit an exception when attempting to set its value: [&lt;UIButton 0x7f9278591260&gt; setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key spacingBetweenLabelAndImage.Still, runtime it renders like I intended it to render and it also honours that same custom spacing I've added through IB.Here's the code of the menubutton that rearranges the button and the title:#import ""HamburgerButton.h""IB_DESIGNABLE@interface HamburgerImageButton : HamburgerButton@property IBInspectable CGFloat spacingBetweenLabelAndImage;@endImplementation:#import ""HamburgerImageButton.h""@implementation HamburgerImageButton- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect {    [super drawRect:rect];    CGSize imageSize = self.imageView.frame.size;    CGSize titleSize = self.titleLabel.frame.size;    // Move the label left and the image right by half the width    CGFloat leftInset = titleSize.width / 2;    CGFloat rightInset = imageSize.width / 2;    CGFloat halfSpacing = self.spacingBetweenLabelAndImage == 0 ? 0 : self.spacingBetweenLabelAndImage / 2;    CGFloat topInset = imageSize.height / 2 + halfSpacing;    CGFloat bottomInset = titleSize.height / 2 + halfSpacing;    UIEdgeInsets imageInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(-bottomInset, leftInset, bottomInset, -leftInset);    UIEdgeInsets titleInsets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(topInset, -rightInset, -topInset, rightInset);    self.imageEdgeInsets = imageInsets;    self.titleEdgeInsets = titleInsets;}@endYou've probably noticed it inherits HamburgerButton. This basic hamburger button does not have an image and it only draws the border around the button. This basic hamburger button has exactly the same problem: it does not draw it's border in drawRect in IB and it has the same type of errors. Here's that code for sake of completeness:#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;IB_DESIGNABLE@interface HamburgerButton : UIButton@property IBInspectable CGFloat borderWidth;@property IBInspectable UIColor *borderColor;@endImplementation:#import ""HamburgerButton.h""#import &lt;QuartzCore/QuartzCore.h&gt;@implementation HamburgerButton- (void)copyInspectables {    self.layer.borderWidth = self.borderWidth;    self.layer.borderColor = self.borderColor.CGColor;}- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect {    [self copyInspectables];}@endI don't really understand why it just throws a warning and nothing else. I didn't really change what I did. I've checked the storyboard, it's iOS 7 and up, meant to run in Xcode 6 (latest).It complains about not being able to find that value on UIButton and that's a bit weird because I've subclassed it.Update: So I changed everything around and it worked.

6584,"HTML5 Drag and Drop effectAllowed and dropEffect The relationship between these two properties seems to have been the source of some confusion.  Based on reading both the MDN site and MSDN I thought i had figured it out, but now I am not sure...I figured that when an element is dragged, you can specify what is allowed to happen to it (i.e. it can be moved, copied, linked to - one of the effectAllowed constants). This is the effectAllowed property.Different drop targets do different things, so when you dragover another element it can control which &quot;effect&quot; takes place on the drop, this is the &quot;dropEffect&quot; property. So I set up a simple example to test this theory out.JSFiddle$(&quot;[draggable='true']&quot;).on(&quot;dragstart&quot;, function(e) {    var dt =  e.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    dt.effectAllowed = &quot;copyMove&quot;;    dt.setData(&quot;text/plain&quot;, &quot;Foo&quot;);});$(&quot;#dropZoneCopy&quot;).on(&quot;dragover&quot;, function(e) {    var dt =  e.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    dt.dropEffect = &quot;copy&quot;;    e.preventDefault();});$(&quot;#dropZoneMove&quot;).on(&quot;dragover&quot;, function(e) {    var dt =  e.originalEvent.dataTransfer;    dt.dropEffect = &quot;move&quot;;    e.preventDefault();});I have a box the user can drag - the effects allowed are &quot;copyMove&quot;. I have one box that sets dropEffect to copy, and once that sets dropEffect to move.  What I expect is that when the user drags over the &quot;copy box&quot; the cursor will change to indicate a copy will happen, as I drag over the &quot;move box&quot; the cursor changes to indicate a move...Only Chrome behaves as I would expect.  Is this because the other browser are wrong or because I don't understand the spec. properly ?UPDATESome more information from fiddling with this.In both Firefox and Chrome, if you have a dragsource which indicates the effectAllowed is &quot;copy&quot; and a dropzone that says dropEffect is &quot;move&quot; then you cannot drop on the drop zone even if you cancel the event. I thought that dropEffect would be useful to read ondrop to see what to do, but it isn't available on Chrome, the dropEffect does not appear on the drop handler, e.g. trying to read the dataTransfer.dropEffect will say that the dropEffect is &quot;none&quot; even though you set it on dragover.  Setting the dropEffect as noted above does influence the way the cursor is displayed.On Firefox, the dropEffect does come through on the dropzone after being set on dragover, but it does not influence the display of the mouse cursor. On Firefox windows pressing the ctrl key does affect the display of the mouse, but does not affect the dropEffect property.The spec shows that the source can listen for the dragend event to see what happened. It should look at the dropEffect within this event. Chrome, Mozilla and Safari work as you would hope here, the drop effect appears in the dragend event. In IE if the effect allowed is a simple value e.g. &quot;copy&quot; then any succesfull drop results in this value appearing as the dropEffect on dragend. If the effectAllowed was a compound value like copyMove and you tried to select &quot;move&quot; on dragover by setting the dropEffect, you're out of luck, that will come through as dropEffect = &quot;none&quot; at the source on dragend. You are stuck with one cursor &amp; one dropEffect and that is the effectAllowed set on dragstart if that effect is a simple value. Interestingly the dropEffect it seems does come through when you drag into a native application from IE11 at least (and i assume earlier).Other notesOn Safari on a mac - effectAllowed cannot be set programatically, therefore any dropEffect that gets set is valid. When you press the cmd key the effectAllowed becomes &quot;move&quot; and when you press the alt key the effectAllowed becomes &quot;copy&quot;. Thereafter it works as you would hope, if the dropEffect is not one of these effectAlloweds the drop is not allowed by the browser.More InfoI've been spending some spare time working on an HTML5 drag and drop library i wrote a bunch more about this and other issues in the docs for it, if you're interested please take a look atthe project",javascript

The SQLite store offers slightly better security than the XML and binary stores, but it should not be considered inherently secure. Note that you should also consider the security of store metadata since it is possible for data archived in the metadata to be tampered with independently of the store data. If you want to ensure data security, you should use a technology such as an encrypted disk image.That doesn't make me clear what I should do...

47269,"What is the URL of the google chrome new tab page and how to exclude it from manifest.json I am currently building a simple google chrome extension to prank my brother. The Extension simply deletes the old page and replaces it with HTML and CSS copied off of the ""You have no internet"" page, In essence making the user think they don't have internet when they do. The following is the content script injected into all new pages:var hed = document.head;var bod = document.body;document.head.parentElement.removeChild(document.head);document.body.parentElement.removeChild(document.body);document.write(/*Copy of ""no internet"" page source here*/);This script works perfectly. The only page i don't want the change to occur on is the google chrome New Tab page. The way to go about normally excluding pages is to specify it in the Extensions manifest.json file under the content scripts. Here was my original manifest.json setup:{    ""manifest_version"": 2,    ""name"": ""No Internet Extention"",    ""description"": ""Make people with this extention think they have no internet"",    ""version"": ""1.0"",    ""content_scripts"":     [        {          ""matches"": [""*://*/*""],          ""js"": [""bup.js""]        }    ],    ""permissions"":     [        ""activeTab"",        ""https://ajax.googleapis.com/""    ]}I have currently tried the following set ups in my manifest.json file content_scripts section in order to exclude the Chrome New Tab page to no avail:""matches"": [""http://*/*"", ""https://*/*""]I assumed this would exclude it because This page on the google product forms Told me that the URL of the New Tab page is ""chrome://newtab"", which is not a HTTP: or HTTPS: Protocol.I also Tried:""matches"": [""*//*/*""]""exclude_matches"": [""chrome://newtab""]""matches"": [""*//*/*""]""exclude_matches"": [""chrome://newtab/*""]""matches"": [""*//*/*""]""exclude_matches"": [""*://newtab/*""]""matches"": [""*//*/*""]""exclude_globs"": [""chrome://newtab""]None of these have worked and the content script still executes on the new tab page.

46565,"How to perform routing in iOS swift modular application? I am working on a very big app and decided to go with the modular approach where each feature is implemented as a Framework and one feature should not ""know"" other features. I decided to use heavily in ReSwift which is a library to build iOS app following the REDUX principles. I've managed to decouple the global App State from all the Feature state so each feature define its own state and its all managed by the global app state. The next challenge that I am facing with is Routing / Navigation. I want to be able to route between one view controller which located in Feature1 to another view controller which located in Feature2 (Remember: I want to avoid dependencies between features so Feature1 is not know anything about Feature2). I know that I can create a central place in my app that can handle all the routes of the application but I wanted to know if there is a way that every Feature will implement its own route. So Feature1 will route to Feature2 without calling to some central implementation. The motivation here is that every Feature will provide its own resources to the app. So in REDUX principles each feature should provide: State, Reducer, Actions and Router but the challenge here is that features is not depended in other feature.P.S. for routing I decided to go with ReSwift-Router which is a declarative routing library for ReSwift apps.

4230,"Unreproducible webcore crashes I've got an iPad app that's in the App Store for around three months now and I've been receiving some weird crash reports that I can't figure out. These are not that frequent, got around 15-20 instances since the launch but still frequent enough to actually bug me. The crashes are slightly different (see stack traces below) but since they are related to WebCore I'm guessing they have to do with the usage of the UIWebView in the app and might have a common cause, though I'm not 100% positive. The deployment target of the app is iOS 6.0 but crashes appear on iPad 2, iPad 3 and iPad Mini, exclusively on iOS 7.There is only one place in the app where I'm using a webview, for displaying news article web pages from various sources. I have one view controller for this that has a UIWebView as its view. There is one instance of this view controller that lives throughout the app, each time a new article is selected the existing webview reloads with the url of the newly selected article. One of the proposed solutions based on the discussion around WebCore issues suggested setting the webviews delegate property to nil in the controller's dealloc method. Unfortunately I don't think it's applicable in my case because the view controller does not get deallocated during the lifecycle of the app.Another issue might be incorrect webpages that have bad image references in the CSS (loadPendingImages crash). I couldn't find such a page yet though.Also, I double-checked and made sure to do webview-related operations on the main thread.The crashes areException Type: EXC_BAD_ACCESS Code: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESSwith the following stack traces (full ones here)0 WebCore WebCore::StyleResolver::applyMatchedProperties(WebCore::StyleResolver::MatchResult const&amp;, WebCore::Element const*) + 8151 WebCore WebCore::StyleResolver::applyMatchedProperties(WebCore::StyleResolver::MatchResult const&amp;, WebCore::Element const*) + 7882 WebCore WebCore::StyleResolver::styleForElement(WebCore::Element*, WebCore::RenderStyle*, WebCore::StyleSharingBehavior, WebCore::RuleMatchingBehavior, WebCore::RenderRegion*) + 9483 WebCore WebCore::Document::styleForElementIgnoringPendingStylesheets(WebCore::Element*) + 964 WebCore WebCore::Element::computedStyle(WebCore::PseudoId) + 1425 WebCore WebCore::ComputedStyleExtractor::propertyValue(WebCore::CSSPropertyID, WebCore::EUpdateLayout) const + 458and0 WebCore WebCore::StyleResolver::loadPendingImages() + 11531 WebCore WebCore::ResourceRequestBase::~ResourceRequestBase() + 1042 WebCore WebCore::StyleResolver::applyMatchedProperties(WebCore::StyleResolver::MatchResult const&amp;, WebCore::Element const*) + 7823 WebCore WebCore::StyleResolver::styleForElement(WebCore::Element*, WebCore::RenderStyle*, WebCore::StyleSharingBehavior, WebCore::RuleMatchingBehavior, WebCore::RenderRegion*) + 9484 WebCore WebCore::Document::styleForElementIgnoringPendingStylesheets(WebCore::Element*) + 965 WebCore WebCore::Element::computedStyle(WebCore::PseudoId) + 142and0 WebCore WebCore::StyleResolver::adjustRenderStyle(WebCore::RenderStyle*, WebCore::RenderStyle*, WebCore::Element*) + 191 WebCore WebCore::StyleResolver::styleForElement(WebCore::Element*, WebCore::RenderStyle*, WebCore::StyleSharingBehavior, WebCore::RuleMatchingBehavior, WebCore::RenderRegion*) + 9642 WebCore WebCore::Document::styleForElementIgnoringPendingStylesheets(WebCore::Element*) + 963 WebCore WebCore::Element::computedStyle(WebCore::PseudoId) + 1424 WebCore WebCore::ComputedStyleExtractor::propertyValue(WebCore::CSSPropertyID, WebCore::EUpdateLayout) const + 4585 WebCore WebCore::CSSComputedStyleDeclaration::getPropertyValue(WebCore::CSSPropertyID) const + 42and0 WebCore WebCore::TimerBase::heapDeleteMin() + 371 WebCore WebCore::ThreadTimers::sharedTimerFiredInternal() + 942 WebCore WebCore::ThreadTimers::sharedTimerFiredInternal() + 943 WebCore WebCore::timerFired(__CFRunLoopTimer*, void*) + 244 CoreFoundation __CFRUNLOOP_IS_CALLING_OUT_TO_A_TIMER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION__ + 145 CoreFoundation __CFRunLoopDoTimer + 782Has anyone experienced similar crashes?

Opened up grunt.cmd file and found the following....This lead me to C:\Users\khollenbeck\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\grunt-cli\bin which contained a file called grunt. And from there at the top of the file. I changed this code #!/usr/bin/env node to #!/usr/bin/env node --debug-brkAfter doing this command node-inspector C:\path\to\gruntfile grunt I got the following.Node Inspector v0.7.3 Visit http://localhost:8080/debug?port=5858 to start debuggingNext I ran the grunt command from grunt dir. (leaving the server running in original command prompt) From here I expected Gruntfile.js to show up in the source of chrome dev tools. I also expected to be able to set breakpoints from there. This did not happen. Instead it just ran all the way through the Gruntfile without breaking or loading in the browser.Edit:  Ah, I see what I did wrong. For some reason I did node --debug-brk  with out adding the path  C:\Users\khollenbeck\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\grunt-cli\bin\grunt.  Its working now, thanks so much. I apologize for dragging this on for  so long. But hopefully this will be useful for other windows users in  the future.",javascript

39606,"How to avoid bind or inline arrow functions inside render method We should avoid method binding inside render because during re-rendering it will create the new methods instead of using the old one, that will affect the performance.So for the scenarios like this:&lt;input onChange = { this._handleChange.bind(this) } ...../&gt;We can bind _handleChange method either in constructor:this._handleChange = this._handleChange.bind(this);Or we can use property initializer syntax:_handleChange = () =&gt; {....}Now lets consider the case where we want to pass some extra parameter, lets say in a simple todo app, onclick of item i need to delete the item from array, for that i need to pass either the item index or the todo name in each onClick method:todos.map(el =&gt; &lt;div key={el} onClick={this._deleteTodo.bind(this, el)}&gt; {el} &lt;/div&gt;)For now just assume that todo names are unique.As per DOC:  The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created  each time the component renders.Question:How to avoid this way of binding inside render method or what are the alternatives of this?Kindly provide any reference or example, thanks.",javascript

49252,"Best data persistence for Angularjs/Javascript Apps on PhoneGap? I am looking to find best practices for Angularjs data persistence on a PhoneGap app. I'm using Ionic Framework on top of this, but not relevant to this question as it is just built on top of Angular &amp; Cordova.I like that Angular remains flexible on data persistence solutions, it makes sense since it is a web framework not specifically a Hybrid app framework... would love to know how people are solving this.Here's an overview:RequirementsAdd local database to app build for preloaded data. This will be over the 5MB data limit.Load data from local database on startup.Saving updated data to local data store for persistence.Prefer schema-less if possible.Simple query interface. I could load all the data into memory and just use standard Angular filters for this, provided the performance was decent.Object query interface... something like an ActiveRecord-like ORM rather than having to write SQL in my app.Future proof. I don't want to reinvent the wheel every time I am building an app that needs data persistence. Also would like to choose something that is more standard if possible so I can continue to use it in the future... something like Indexeddb would make sense here.OptionsI've been looking at the following options. Can you provide any feedback on any of these?Breezejs - Looks more focused on server. Is there an SQLite interface?YDN-DB - Seems like an option, but also seems a little obscure compared to some of the other options.JayData - Is this still active? Concerned about commercial aspect of it. Persistencejs - This looks promising. Is the project still active?ngStorage - is this just a localStorage interface? Does it solve the 5M limit?Angular-cache - Can I have data to pre-load with this? How long can I persist data?localForage - don't know much about this. Does it solve the 5M limit?Pouchdb - concerned about query language. does not solve 5M restrictionCouchdb Lite - concerned about query language. WebSQL - I don't to use this since it seems like it is on the way out.. plus 5M limit.Indexeddb - There is a shim that builds compat-layer for most major browsers. 5M limit. If I could use this on top of Sqlite that would prob be a winner for me since more standards based.Store in json file - Just use plain old objects and then use Phonegap file api to load and store serialized data. Seems like a pain to have to serialize all the data every time we want to save... but an option so long as I can use Angular filters.Sorry for the long post. I really would like to see some thoughts on best practices. Would love an Angular Way to handle large data persistence on Hybrid mobile apps.Thanks",javascript

16316,"What are the pros and cons of running IIS as 32bit vs 64bit on a 64bit OS? Possibly better suited for ""Rack Overflow"", but from a developer's point of view, what are the advantages and disadvantages of running IIS (serving both legacy classic ASP and .NET) as a 32bit process instead of a 64bit process on a 64bit windows host? The main advantage of 32/64 (iis/server) over 32/32 seems to be the ability to go up to 4gb in memory per IIS process. The advantages I expect of 32/64 over 64/64 appear to be that it's easier to access legacy 32-bit in-process DLLs (of which we still have one from a partner vendor we can't move away from immediately) and perhaps a smaller memory footprint for the same code given smaller memory pointers. Are there any performance benefits of 64/64 over 32/64 or anything else that would warrant a full switch now? Have I made any false assumptions here?",asp.net
16011,"UIStatusBar as in Facebook new iOS7 application I have an app with side bar menu, kinda like Facebook side bar menu. I'm using this class called SWRevealViewController and it's working great. Now since iOS7 has came out, I just can't figure out how to adjust my Status and Navigation Bar to be like in Facebook app.As you can see, in the Facebook app, when the user slides the screen and open's the menu, the status bar turn from the Navigation Bar blue color to black with Fade animation. In my app, the user slides the screen to open the menu and the status bar with the blue color (that is blue because of that view NavigationBar) won't fade away and change the color into black.Also, another issue that I'm having, I just can't change the StatusBar text color to white. I've tried everything, every piece of code on the internet, read all apple's documentation, but still couldn't manage to change the color.I also used this code:- (UIStatusBarAnimation)preferredStatusBarUpdateAnimation {    return UIStatusBarAnimationFade;}- (UIStatusBarStyle)preferredStatusBarStyle {    return UIStatusBarStyleLightContent;}- (BOOL)prefersStatusBarHidden{    return NO;}Thanks in advance.========================================================================UPDATE: The solution to this problem as in @yoeriboven answer is to put 2 views on top of the SWRevealViewController with black color and blue color and just animate the two, this is a great solution and it worked just great.So, when creating the revealController I've created 2 blank UIViews and added them, one blue and one black. One of them, the black one, I kept hidden for now.self.revealController = [[SWRevealViewController alloc] initWithRearViewController:nil frontViewController:self.frontViewController];self.revealController.delegate = self;self.appDelegate.window.rootViewController = self.revealController;self.statusBarBlack = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.appDelegate.window.frame.size.width, 20)];[self.statusBarBlack setBackgroundColor:[UIColor blackColor]];self.statusBarBlue = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, self.appDelegate.window.frame.size.width, 20)];[self.statusBarBlue setBackgroundColor:[UIColor blueColor]];[self.appDelegate.window.rootViewController.view addSubview:self.statusBarBlack];[self.appDelegate.window.rootViewController.view addSubview:self.statusBarBlue];Now if you are using SWRevealViewController you can use the next code, if not, just build it on your own, inside SWRevealViewController.m just #import ""AppDelegate.h"" and than replace the touchesMoved method with this one:- (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{    [super touchesMoved:touches withEvent:event];    if (self.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateFailed)        return;    //  Change color of status bar by the location of your swipe    AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate*)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;    UITouch *currentTouch = [touches anyObject];    CGPoint currentTouchLocationOnWindow = [currentTouch locationInView:appDelegate.window];    appDelegate.splashScreen.blueStatusBar.alpha = currentTouchLocationOnWindow.x / appDelegate.window.frame.size.width;    if ( _dragging )        return;    const int kDirectionPanThreshold = 5;    UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];    CGPoint nowPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view];    CGFloat moveX = nowPoint.x - _init.x;    CGFloat moveY = nowPoint.y - _init.y;    if (abs(moveX) &gt; kDirectionPanThreshold)    {        if (_direction == SWDirectionPanGestureRecognizerHorizontal)            _dragging = YES;        else            self.state = UIGestureRecognizerStateFailed;    }    else if (abs(moveY) &gt; kDirectionPanThreshold)    {        if (_direction == SWDirectionPanGestureRecognizerVertical)            _dragging = YES ;        else            self.state = UIGestureRecognizerStateFailed;    }}Now go down a little bit and search for the method rightRevealToggleAnimated and replace her with this one:- (void)rightRevealToggleAnimated:(BOOL)animated{    FrontViewPosition toogledFrontViewPosition = FrontViewPositionLeft;    if (_frontViewPosition &gt;= FrontViewPositionLeft) {        toogledFrontViewPosition = FrontViewPositionLeftSide;        [UIView animateWithDuration:0.3 animations:^{            //  Change color of status bar            AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate*)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;            appDelegate.splashScreen.blueStatusBar.alpha = 0.0;        }];    } else {        [UIView animateWithDuration:0.3 animations:^{            //  Change color of status bar            AppDelegate *appDelegate = (AppDelegate*)[UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate;            appDelegate.splashScreen.blueStatusBar.alpha = 1.0;        }];    }    [self setFrontViewPosition:toogledFrontViewPosition animated:animated];}That should do the trick, enjoy!",ios
4361,"How to import a module in es6 that itself needs to invoke/initialize its function/class before being imported I was wondering what is the best practice to import a module's function/class in another module that the module itself needs to invoke/initialize its own function/class before being imported into another module? I don't know if I could ask my question clearly enough! So let's put it in an example.This is my module:// myModule.jsclass MyModule {  constructor() {    // do sth  }}let myModule = new MyModule();And this is how I like to import it in another module:import MyModule from './myModule';This actually works fine! But as you can see, in the myModule.js file I didn't export default my MyModule class because that's not the only thing that is happening in the myModule.js file! I'm also initializing the class after defining it... (I know that even if I have set my class as export default the initializing would still work fine while the module is imported somewhere else...)So, without setting anything as exported inside of our module, or with setting the class as the export default, everything works fine when the module has been imported somewhere else... So far so good! But I'm looking for a best practice if there's one!So here are my questions regarding such cases:Is it ok to import a module that doesn't have anything for export?  Shall we set the class as the export default, although we are doing some more works outside of the class in the module (The initializing job that is happening after defining the class)?  Or maybe is it good to do the initializing job in another function and then export both, the class and the function, and then invoke the function to do the initializing job in the imported module?  Thanks a lot everyone! I really appreciate any helps regarding this :)",javascript
47288,"apple watch - slow image animation first time I'm building a small app for apple watch. I have a Group and a Label inside of it. What I'm trying to do is:animate background image of the groupfade in label after image animation endsMy code looks essentially like this:        group.setBackgroundImageNamed(""show_back-"");        group.startAnimatingWithImagesInRange(NSMakeRange(0, 39), duration: 1.5, repeatCount: 1);        let delayTime = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, Int64(1.5 * Double(NSEC_PER_SEC)))        dispatch_after(delayTime, dispatch_get_main_queue()) { () -&gt; Void in            self.animateWithDuration(1) { () -&gt; Void in                self.label.setAlpha(1)            };        };The problem is that the first time this sequence is triggered, the image animation seems to run slower than 1.5 seconds, because the label starts fading in earlier than the images stop changing. If this is triggered again while the app is running, everything works as expected. I guess it has something to do with images preloading or something.How can I make it work consistently? I couldn't find any sort of callback on image sequence animation end to subscribe to.EDITAnother problem I've noticed: I have another case when bg is animated from a dispatch_after block, and when I leave the app by tapping the crown and return by double-tapping it, either the dispatch_after block is not triggered, or the background animation is not rendered correctly the first time it is invoked (I think the second, because I tried adding a breakpoint into the dispatch block and it triggered every time I tested). I'm running watchOS2, so maybe it is related to the beta state the OS is currently in?",ios

46514,"Proper OAuth2 flow for public first-party clients I'm a regular reader here at stack overflow but this is my first question.I'm developing an authorization-server using the OAuth2 specs. And I just got stuck with how do I ensure the first-party client authenticity while using the password flow. I read many forums and this is what I got:Javascript single-page clientsThis blog post by Alex Bilbie, he states that to avoid the client_secret   problem we should just:  It’s simple; proxy all of your API calls via a thin server side  component. This component (let’s just call it a proxy from here on)  will authenticate ajax requests from the user’s session. The access  and refresh tokens can be stored in an encrypted form in a cookie  which only the proxy can decrypt. The application client credentials  will also be hardcoded into the proxy so they’re not publicly  accessible either.But now this proxy can be accessed by someone impersonating myangular app. And then I came across this blog post from AndyFielder: How Secure is the OAuth2 Resourc Owner Password Flow for Single Page Apps. He basically says to rely on CORS to avoid impersonating JS clients.It is a good idea to use both approaches to secure my JS app?Native Apps (Desktop and Mobile)In the case of mobile apps, I only found cases for AuthorizationCode and Implicit flows. This is not what I want, as the redirectswill compromise the user experience. So my thoughts on this is: I will use the ROP flow and then register the client with aclient_id generated for this particular installation and attach itto the user account, receiving the access_token and aclient_secret as response. Any other token request made by thisclient MUST carry this credentials (as the client_id is specificfor the installation, I will be able to check if this client isalready authenticated). This way if someone uses any credential forimpersonating a client, or even registers a bogus client, I can takemesures to revoke the user and client access.I know that this can be overthinking, and I also know that some of this matters doesn't avoid anything. I just feel that is my job to protect my API as much as I can.I would really appreciate your thoughts about this matters! Am I really overthinking? Should I just use the concept of a 'public client' and carry on?Thank you all and happy coding!",javascript
46771,"How to Convert any of the 5 Islamic (Hijri) Calendars' Dates to any of 18 World Calendars without External Libraries or Complex Astronomical Formulas Searching on both StackOverflow and CodeReview sites, the Method described in this Question/Post has not been attempted; which is to convert the 5 Islamic Calendars' Dates to any of the 18 available calendars in Javascript without the use of External Date Libraries or using complex math/astronomical formulas.Hope this post complies with StackOverflow Can I answer my own question? recommended policy guidelines for sharing new conceptual code with the community.Javascript Intl.DateTimeFormat()We all know that Javascript has a built-in method ( the Intl.DateTimeFormat() ) to convert Gregorian Dates into various calendars' dates (18 World Calendars) including the formatting of the output string.However, Javascript does not provide a built-in method for the reverse operation, i.e. converting the 18 world calendar dates back into Gregorian Dates (including the Islamic Calendars Dates) or into other calendars. For such purposes, you will need to use External Date Libraries to do the conversion such as 'moment.js' and many others.The method/code used here does not use external libraries and uses the Javascript Calendar Conversion by Target Approximation Method. The flowchart below summarises the concept of the Method which can be applied to convert other Calendars to the remaining Calendars.The short Javascript function below provides the facilities to convert any of the five (5) Islamic (Hijri) Calendars' Dates (from Islamic year -280,803 AH to +281,510 AH) into any of the following 18 Javascript Calendars with options for formatting the resulting output:&quot;buddhist&quot;, &quot;chinese&quot;, &quot;coptic&quot;, &quot;dangi&quot;, &quot;ethioaa&quot;, &quot;ethiopic&quot;, &quot;gregory&quot;, &quot;hebrew&quot;, &quot;indian&quot;, &quot;islamic&quot;, &quot;islamic-umalqura&quot;, &quot;islamic-tbla&quot;, &quot;islamic-civil&quot;, &quot;islamic-rgsa&quot;, &quot;iso8601&quot;, &quot;japanese&quot;, &quot;persian&quot;, &quot;roc&quot;, &quot;islamicc&quot;.The method does not use external libraries and does not use complex mathematical or astronomical formulas and relies solely on the Javascript built-in calendar conversion algorithms which are in turn based on the ICU code [https://icu.unicode.org/].This approach ensures that the output is always accurate and fully compliant with the Javascript engine output.While some external libraries are very good, they tend over time to lose the update and support; an example is the recent case of the 'moment.js' library.SyntaxThe function Syntax is:hijriToCalendars(year, month, day, [options])In its simplest form, the function defaults to converting the 'islamic-umalqura' calendar which is the most common and recent Islamic Calendar used.It will also default to convert into the Gregorian calendar using the ISO Date Format.Example: Convert the Islamic Date 21 Rajab 1443 (i.e. 21/07/1443) to Gregorian.hijriToCalendars(1443,7,21);output: 2022-02-22T00:00:00.000Z    // default output Gregorian ISO formatTo to convert Islamic Date to another calendar (say 'Persian' calendar): hijriToCalendars(1443,7,21, { toCal: &quot;persian&quot; }); output: 12/3/1400 APTo add formatting to the output, use the 'dateStyle' options as in the Javascript Intl.DateTimeFormat() method.Example: Convert Islamic Date to Persian Date with full dateStyle hijriToCalendars(1443,7,21, { toCal: &quot;persian&quot;, dateStyle: &quot;full&quot; }); output: Tuesday, Esfand 3, 1400 APExample: Convert an Islamic Date into Hebrew with Arabic Locale hijriToCalendars(1443,7,21,{ toCal:&quot;hebrew&quot;, dateStyle: &quot;full&quot;, locale:&quot;ar&quot;}) output: الثلاثاء، ٢١ آذار الأول ٥٧٨٢ صThe above can be done for all other 18 Calendars.An added feature is the ability to format the Islamic Date into any of the available 'dateStyles' and 'locales' without conversion.To do that specify the 'toCal' to be the same as the Islamic input calendar, for the default use: 'islamic-umalqura'.Example: Use Persian Locale to Format an Islamic Date hijriToCalendars(1443,7,21,{toCal:&quot;islamic-umalqura&quot;,dateStyle:&quot;full&quot;, locale:&quot;fa&quot;})); output:  سه‌شنبه ۲۱ رجب ۱۴۴۳ ه‍.ق.          // mind the RTL requirementsExample: Format an Islamic Date in the Hindi Locale hijriToCalendars(1443,7,21,{ toCal : &quot;islamic-umalqura&quot;, dateStyle : &quot;full&quot;, locale : &quot;hi&quot;})); output: AH मंगलवार, 21 रजब 1443The default input Islamic Calendar is 'islamic-umalqura', however, you can change that to any of the five (5) Islamic Calendars using the 'fromCal' option.Example: Convert the Islamic-Civil Date 21 Rajab 1443 (i.e. 21/07/1443) to Gregorian. hijriToCalendars(1443,7,21, {fromCal : &quot;islamic-civil&quot; }); output: 2022-02-23T00:00:00.000ZYou can see from the above that the islamic-civil date differs by 1 day from the islamic-umalqura date.You can use all the options available in the Intl.DateTimeFormat() for formatting the output date.Invalid Islamic DatesIf an invalid Islamic Date is passed to the function an error Invalid islamic-xxxxx date! will be generated.Invalid Islamic Dates are dates that have incorrect days in the month or incorrect days or months.For example, the Islamic Date 1443/2/30 is invalid because month 2 of the Hijri Calendar (month &quot;Safar&quot;) is always 29 days and cannot be 30 days.Also, for example, the Islamic date 1442/12/30 will throw an error because the year 1442 is a non-leap year and month 12 is only 29 days.Is this Method Reliable and Accurate?If you consider the internal Javascript ICU code to be reliable and accurate, then this Method solely uses the date generated from inside the Javascript Engine. There is no concern about external incorrect math or errors/bugs in the code unless they are inside the Javascript Engine itself.Below is the function with example test cases for conversion and formatting which can be run and tested.Examples are given for converting an Islamic Date (1443/7/21) which happens to be today's date into all other Calendars' formats.Any improvements/suggestions/alternatives are appreciated./*********************************************************************************** @function  : hijriToCalendars(year, month, day, [options])** @purpose   : Converts Islamic (Hijri) Date to other Calendars' Dates.*              Handles Hijri dates from -280,803 AH to +281,510 AH.*              Handles all 5 Islamic Calendar Types.*              Uses the 'JS Calendar Conversion by Target Approximation' Method.*              No external libraries or complex mathematical/astronomical formulas.** @version   : 1.00* @author    : Mohsen Alyafei* @date      : 21 Feb 2022* @licence   : MIT* @param     : year   : (numeric) [required] Hijri year  (-280803 to 281510)* @param     : month  : (numeric) [required] hijri month (1 to 12) note: months is standard 1 based* @param     : day    : (numeric) [required] hijri day   (1 to 29/30)* @param     : options: Object with the following optional parameters:**              'fromCal': Specifies the the type of input Islamic Calendar with 5 options:*                         - 'islamic-umalqura' (default)*                         - 'islamic-civil'*                         - 'islamic-tbla'*                         - 'islamic-rgsa'*                         - 'islamic'**              'toCal' : Specifies the the type of output Calendar to convert to with 19 Calendars:*                        - ""gregory"" : (default)*                        - ""buddhist"", ""chinese"", ""coptic"", ""dangi"", ""ethioaa"", ""ethiopic"",*                          ""hebrew"", ""indian"", ""islamic"", ""islamic-umalqura"", ""islamic-tbla"",*                          ""islamic-civil"", ""islamic-rgsa"", ""iso8601"", ""japanese"", ""persian"", ""roc"".**               'dateStyle' Same as used in the Intl.DateTimeFormat() constructor.*                           If not stated, default output is in Gregorian ISO Format: YYYY:MM:DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ**               'locale' The BCP 47 language tag for formatting (default is 'en').**               Other options: As used in the Intl.DateTimeFormat() constructor.** @returns   : Return the date in the calendar and format of the specified options.***********************************************************************************///**********************************************************************************function hijriToCalendars(year, month, day, op={}) { op.fromCal ??= ""islamic-umalqura"";   //let   gD      = new Date(Date.UTC(2000,0,1));      gD      = new Date(gD.setUTCDate(gD.getUTCDate() +                ~~(227022+(year+(month-1)/12+day/354)*354.367)));const gY      = gD.getUTCFullYear(gD)-2000,      dFormat = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-u-ca-' + op.fromCal, {dateStyle:'short', timeZone:'UTC'});      gD      = new Date(( gY &lt; 0 ?

46459,"Precompile ASP.NET MVC views on Azure Web App Is there a way to precompile the ASP.NET MVC views on an Azure Web App (specifically when published via Release Management on VSTS)?Once each view has been hit once, the page subsequently renders very quickly. But that first delay can be a doozy for users and there's no way to script touching each page. I'm not sure if I need to change something in the build/release processes on VSTS (I am using the Visual Studio Build build step and the Azure Web App release task) or if I need to run something on the Azure Web App instance after it is released (or something else altogether).It seems like finding some way to call aspnet_compiler after publish might be what I need (and I have seen that in reference to Web Roles on Cloud Services) but I can't get that to work. Calling %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\aspnet_compiler -v ""/"" -p ""d:\home\site\wwwroot"" via the Console in the Azure Portal executes just fine (and finds errors if there are any) but doesn't have any impact on startup time - hitting a view the first time still takes a long time. So maybe that isn't the right direction.I've looked at RazorGenerator (including the .MSBuild nuget package) and I couldn't quite get it to work, but really I was hesitant to make so many changes to the projects just to get precompilation on release.Also note that I am currently using TFVC, not Git, in VSTS, so the Kudu/Git integration (that does seem to trigger the precompilation according to some articles) isn't available to me as far as I can tell.Other ideas?",asp.net

46583,"react-native: push notifications + parse I am currently working on a small app project to learn and try out react-native on iOS. I have some experience with parse (parse.com) and would love to integreate parse in the new app. Currently, I have no problems including parse js into react-native. I am able to log in with accounts etc. Now I need to send push notifications to a certain number of users (not all users).What I don't understand is how push notifications should work with react-native and parse. Usually, I would connect a device installation with a user ID and then send a push to a certain number of users (which means to the devices with the corresponding installation). The react-native guide (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/pushnotificationios.html#content) doesn't mention anything like that. And even though it gives the parse guide as a reference, I fail to see how I should be able to send pushes via parse. The guide leaves a lot of information to be desired too. To what source do these ""Listeners"" subscribe to? From which server am I going to send notifications etc?As I understand, parse js is not able to read the current installation. I hesitate to add Parse iOS to the project too. This feels unnatural and shouldn't be a required thing to do although it would allow me to read the current installation. (but still parse js is not able to register that installation in order to subscribe to push notifications).At this point, I feel a little bit lost.

When I use the one tap slide gesture in the voice over accessibility mode to go through all UI elements in my view from top to bottom, voice over only reads the accessibility labels up to the beginning/last visible buttons within the scroll view, then starts to read out other UI components in the view.The accessibilityScroll delegate Protocol function only gets called if the user performs an actual scroll within the scroll view so this will not be fit for my scenario where a user is only using the one tap slide gesture to navigate through all the UI components in the view.Is there a way I can determine what subview array button is currently being read out in voice over mode so I can scroll to a particular offset/button position within the scrollview to have buttons currently offset be brought into the view so they can also be read out? Or is there a simpler way to achieve what I want? I would appreciate your advice. Thanks  ",ios
2417,IHttpHandler vs IHttpModule My question is simple (although the answer will most likely not be):  I'm trying to decide how to implement a server side upload handler in C# / ASP.NET.  I've used both HttpModules (IHttpModule interface) and HttpHandlers (IHttpHandler interface) and it occurs to me that I could implement this using either mechanism.  It also occurs to me that I don't understand the differences between the two.So my question is this:  In what cases would I choose to use IHttpHandler instead of IHttpModule (and vice/versa)?Is one executed much higher in the pipeline?  Is one much easier to configure in certain situations?  Does one not work well with medium security?,"c#,asp.net"

In the actual component, here is the login method:login(data, isValid) {    if(isValid) {      this.authService.login(data.email, data.password)          .then(              (data) =&gt; {                console.log('data', data);                this.router.navigate(['/projects'])              }, error =&gt; {                this._utilities.createToasty({                  msg: ""The email/password combination is incorrect."",                  type: ""error""                });              }          );    }  }And in the auth service, here's the login method:login(email, password) {    return firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);  }So right now, I'm not entirely sure what code I need to put where to ensure that when my user refreshes the page, the auth guard picks up on that and actually allows the user to go to the route instead of always redirecting to the /login route.Thoughts?",javascript

13302,"iPad toolbar icons: bar button images not centered? Have a look at the following screenshot fragment from an iPad app I am working on:The ""chat bubble"" icon on the left is from the famous Glyphish icon set. Note how it has correct vertical positioning (in the middle), but is much darker than the greyscale used for the InfoDark button. The code to make this icon is as follows:UIImage* image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""02-chat.png""];CGRect frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, image.size.width, image.size.height);UIButton* button = [[UIButton alloc] initWithFrame:frame];[button setBackgroundImage:image forState:UIControlStateNormal];[button addTarget:nil action:NULL forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];[button setShowsTouchWhenHighlighted:YES];UIBarButtonItem* chatBarButtonItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithCustomView:button];The ""chat bubble"" icon in the middle is created using the same image, using different code. Note how it has had correct colouring/transparency, but has incorrect vertical positioning (too high).:UIImage* image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""02-chat.png""];UIBarButtonItem* chatBarButtonItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithImage:image style:UIBarButtonItemStylePlain target:nil action:NULL];How do I get a UIBarButtonItem button that has both correct colouring/transparency (so I don't have to do it manually), as well as correct vertical positioning?Is one or the other a bug, either in my code, or with Apple's? Or both? Or neither (i.e. it's ""as designed"")?Edit: Responses to answers  It looks like the first version is  using the image as a mask, rather than  as a regular image.It looks like it, but it's not the case. If I substitute the image with one that was hand-lightened by a friend with Photoshop, and use a UIButton, the positioning and colouring are correct. I am just trying to find away around that manual step.  Keep in mind that putting UIResponder  objects (e.g. UIButton) inside a  UIBarButtonItem gives unpredictable  results, and I've found it's best to  avoid it.Do you have a source? (Especially an Apple link?) Never heard that.  Redesign the image to be your own.  That is the best and only way to  ensure proper sizing, gradients and  position of all your tool bar icons.I don't necessarily disagree. However, this is a manual step I want to eliminate. It should be possible to get the behaviour I desire without requiring editing. (Especially since I get both halves of the desired behaviour using the existing frameworks. Just not at the same time)  Best for a toolbar is 25x25 and  50x50@2x. Sometimes you may need to go  as low as 23.Is this something official from Apple? Perhaps from the HIG? Can you provide a source?  You could try setting imageInsets on  it to push it down.This is also a needlessly manual process. The worst part is this needs to be hand-tuned for each image, and if an image changes in any way, it has to be double-checked. Way too much work. I want to just set it to an image and let the underlying framework work out how to centre the image.",ios

If AngularJS doesn't support it out of the box, I presume that there must be an easier way to deal with dates.  How does one deal with dates in AngularJS?

41569,"Dynamic loading of external modules in webpack fails I am trying to set up the following architecture: a core React application that gets built with some basic functionality, and the ability to load additional React components at runtime. These additional React components can be loaded on-demand, and they are not available at build time for the core application (so they cannot be included in the bundles for the core application, and must be built separately). After researching for some time, I came across Webpack Externals, which seemed like a good fit. I am now building my modules separately using the following webpack.config.js:const path = require('path');const fs = require('fs');process.env.BABEL_ENV = 'production';process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production';const appDirectory = fs.realpathSync(process.cwd());const resolveApp = relativePath =&gt; path.resolve(appDirectory, relativePath);module.exports = {  entry: './src/MyModule.jsx',  output: {    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),    filename: 'MyModule.js',    library: 'MyModule',    libraryTarget: 'umd'  },   externals: {    ""react"": ""react"",    ""semantic-ui-react"": ""semantic-ui-react""   },   module: {    rules: [        {            test: /\.(js|jsx|mjs)$/,            include: resolveApp('src'),            loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),            options: {                            compact: true,            },        }    ]  },  resolve: {    extensions: ['.wasm', '.mjs', '.js', '.json', '.jsx']  }};Took a look at the generated MyModule.js file, and it looks correct to me.Now, in my core app, I am importing the module as follows:let myComponent = React.lazy(() =&gt; import(componentName + '.js'));where componentName is the variable that matches the name of my module, in this case, ""MyModule"" The name is not known at build time, and the file is not present in the src folder at build time. To avoid errors from webpack when building this code with an unknown import, I have added the following to my webpack.config.js for the core project:module.exports = {    externals: function (context, request, callback/*(err, result)*/) {        if (request === './MyModule.js') {            callback(null, ""umd "" + request);        } else {            callback();        }    }}I have confirmed that the function in externals gets called during the build, and the if condition is matched for this module. The build succeeds, and I am able to run my core application. Then, to test dynamic loading, I drop MyModule.js into the static/js folder where the bundles for my core app live, then I navigate to the page in my core app that requests MyModule via let myComponent = React.lazy(() =&gt; import(componentName + '.js'));I see a runtime error in the console on the import line, TypeError: undefined is not a function    at Array.map (&lt;anonymous&gt;)    at webpackAsyncContext My guess is it's failing to find the module. I don't understand where it is looking for the module, or how to get more information to debug.",javascript

If it happens once it will keep happening for the next few requests, but will eventually work again shortly thereafter.Based on the analytics, user reviews, and user bug reports: it is affecting a large percentage of users, but not 100% of them.-The backend is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Served as a Docker app, using an Nginx proxy server, and multiple instances behind a load balancer.I've tried increasing and decreasing the instance sizes and it seemed to make no difference.I recently made an entirely new Elastic Beanstalk environment from scratch, to see if that helped. Previously it was using the Classic Load Balancer, now it is using the Application Load Balancer. Early indications are it has reduced the number of SSL errors, but they are still occurring.The new load balancer is using this SSL policy:ELBSecurityPolicy-FS-2018-06Which is defined here:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.htmlShould it be using a different SSL policy?-In the app the web requests were being made using URLSession.shared.dataTask... etc. And I've also tried using the Alamofire library to see if that made a difference. It did not.I feel like this may have something to do with Apple's App Transport Security. However, as it fails intermittently I'm at a loss as to how.The relevant Apple docs are the bottom of this page:https://developer.apple.com/security/If you need more information to help debug please let me know.-UPDATE:So after trying many of the suggestions (thank you to everyone who contributed!) - and learning a lot more about SSL, load balancers, etc. - I have found something that has fixed the issue.(Minor caveat: I can't be 100% certain it's completely fixed, due the intermittent nature of the issue and my not so great tracking of it, but all available evidence suggests it is now fixed.)The ""fix"" was to move the service to Google Cloud Run, which is basically serverless for Docker containers.Crucially Google Cloud automatically handles setting up the SSL certificate, so there were zero parts for me to screw up. Another advantage is I'm now only paying for the compute time I'm actually using, so it's cheaper.Apologies to anyone reading this looking for an actual solution to the original problem, but there are a bunch of good things to investigate in the answers and comments below.",ios

8315,"Most memory efficient way to save a photo to disk on iPhone? From profiling with Instruments I have learned that the way I am saving images to disk is resulting in memory spikes to ~60MB. This results in the App emitting low memory warnings, which (inconsistently) leads crashes on the iPhone4S running iOS7.I need the most efficient way to save an image to disk.I am currently using this code + (void)saveImage:(UIImage *)image withName:(NSString *)name {    NSData *data = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(image, 1.0);    DLog(@""*** SIZE *** : Saving file of size %lu"", (unsigned long)[data length]);    NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager];    NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);    NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0];    NSString *fullPath = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:name];    [fileManager createFileAtPath:fullPath contents:data attributes:nil];}Notes:Reducing the value of the compressionQuality argument in UIImageJPEGRepresentation does not reduce the memory spike significantly enough.e.g.compressionQuality = 0.8, reduced the memory spike by 3MB on average over 100 writes.However, it does reduce the size of the data on disk (obviously)but this does not help me.UIImagePNGRepresentation in place of UIImageJPEGRepresentation is worse for this. It is slower and results in higher spikes. Is it possible that this approach with ImageIO would be more efficient? If so why?If anyone has any suggestions it would be great. ThanksEdit:Notes on some of the points outlined in the questions below.a) Although I was saving multiple images, I was not saving them in a loop. I did a bit of reading around and testing and found that an autorelease pool wouldn't help me.b) The photos were not 60Mb in size each. They were photos taken on the iPhone 4S.With this in mind I went back to trying to overcome what I thought the problem was; the line NSData *data = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(image, 1.0);.The memory spikes that were causing the crash can be seen in the screenshot below. They corresponded to when UIImageJPEGRepresentation was called. I also ran Time Profiler and System Usage which pointed me in the same direction.Long story short, I moved over to AVFoundation and took the photo image data usingphotoData = [AVCaptureStillImageOutput jpegStillImageNSDataRepresentation:imageSampleBuffer];Which returns an object of type NSData, I then used this as the data to write using  NSFileManager.This removes the spikes in memory completely.i.e [self saveImageWithData:photoData];where+ (void)saveImageWithData:(NSData *)imageData withName:(NSString *)name {    NSData *data = imageData;    DLog(@""*** SIZE *** : Saving file of size %lu"", (unsigned long)[data length]);    NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager];    NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);    NSString *documentsDirectory = [paths objectAtIndex:0];    NSString *fullPath = [documentsDirectory stringByAppendingPathComponent:name];    [fileManager createFileAtPath:fullPath contents:data attributes:nil];}PS: I have not put this as an answer to the question incase people feel it does not answer the Title ""Most memory efficient way to save a photo to disk on iPhone?"". However, if the consensus is that it should be I can update it.Thanks.",ios
42213,"Touchend not firing after touchmove I'm trying to make a page for mobile devices that detects the scrollTop position and scrolls to the top of the page if scrollTop is lower than half the document height or scroll to bottom if its not.I have achieved that by using this:var ScrollTimeout;$(window).on('scroll',function(){    clearTimeout(ScrollTimeout);    ScrollTimeout = setTimeout(scrollToTopOrBottom,200);    });The problem is that the timeout fires when the user has stopped scrolling but still has the finger on the screen.Then I worked with the touchend event and it was great. $(document).on('touchend',function(){    scrollToTop();    });The user could stopped scrolling (with the finger still on the screen) and then continue scrolling without triggering the scrollToTopOrBottom() function.The problem is, that event is incosistent between browsers:In some browsers (Maxthon and Android), the touchend event worked as intended but in Opera Mobile and Chrome, the touchend event doesn't fires. The explanation for this is that touchend doesn't fires because touchcancel has been fired before.I've tried this$(document).on('touchmove',function(e){    e.preventDefault();    });and succesfully avoided the triggering of touchcancel, but unluckily also avoided the natural behaviour of scrolling.Does anyone know how can this be achieved?

14634,"ES6 Fat Arrow and Parentheses `(...) => ({...})` I've been working through some Graph QL/React/Relay examples and I ran into some strange syntax.When defining the fields in Graph QL Objects the following syntax is used:const xType = new GraphQLObjectType({  name: 'X',  description: 'A made up type for example.',  fields: () =&gt; ({    field: {/*etc.*/}  })});From what I gather this is just defining an anonymous function and assigning it to xType.fields. That anonymous function returns the object containing the field definitions. I'm assuming with however the Graph QL schema mechanism works this has to be defined as a function returning an object rather than simply an object. But the part that has me confused is the parenthesis around the curly braces.Is this to differentiate an object definition from a function definition? Is it for clarity's sake for the reader?The only similar syntax a google search has found is in the airbnb style guide where it seems to be a readability/clarity thing.Just looking for confirmation or an explanation beyond my assumptions as I start to play around with Graph QL a little more.",javascript
7927,"Large, Complex Objects as a Web Service Result Hello again ladies and gents!OK, following on from my other question on ASP.NET Web Service Results, Proxy Classes and Type Conversion. I've come to a part in my project where I need to get my thinking cap on.Basically, we have a large, complex custom object that needs to be returned from a Web Service and consumed in the client application.Now, based on the previous discussion, we know this is going to then take the form of the proxy class(es) as the return type. To overcome this, we need to basically copy the properties from one to the other.In this case, that is something that I would really, really, really! like to avoid!So, it got me thinking, how else could we do this?My current thoughts are to enable the object for complete serialization to XML and then return the XML as a string from the Web Service. We then de-serialize at the client. This will mean a fair bit of attribute decorating, but at least the code at both endpoints will be light, namely by just using the .NET XML Serializer.What are your thoughts on this?","c#,asp.net"

36694,"How to set base URL based on environment variable in Next.js? I have a Strapi backend and Next.js frontend app deployed on DigitalOcean.On DigitalOcean is set an environment variable for the frontend: API_URL = ${APP_URL}/api I fetch this variable to generate the base url:// constants.jsexport const BASE_URL =  process.env.NODE_ENV === &quot;production&quot;    ? process.env.API_URL    : &quot;http://localhost:1337&quot;;It seems to work fine, the app fetch the content from the backend in localhost and in deploy as well. The problem comes when I try to load images which path should be the concatination of the base url and the fetched relative path. I have created a utilitz function for this:// utilities.jsimport { BASE_URL } from &quot;./constants&quot;;export const getImageURL = (relPath) =&gt; `${BASE_URL}${relPath}`;When I use this function for an html img tag it loads both in dev and in prod environments:&lt;img src={getImageURL(homePage.Hero[0].Image.url)} /&gt; But when I try to set a background for a div in the same component the base url is undefined and the image doesn't appear in the deployed site (works fine on localhost).I have no idea why the url generation is OK for some part of the code and not OK for the other.The build command for deploy is: yarn build &amp;&amp; next export -o _staticHere is the full component:import styles from &quot;../styles/Home.module.css&quot;;import { getImageURL } from &quot;../lib/utilities&quot;;import { useEffect } from &quot;react&quot;;import { BASE_URL } from &quot;../lib/constants&quot;;export default function Home({ homePage }) {  console.log(BASE_URL); // undefined  useEffect(() =&gt; {    if (window) {      console.log(BASE_URL); // undefined      document.getElementById(&quot;container&quot;).style.backgroundImage = `url('${getImageURL(homePage.Hero[0].Image.url)}')`; // url is undefined/realtivepath    }  });  return (    &lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;      &lt;img src={getImageURL(homePage.Hero[0].Image.url)} /&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;  );}export const getStaticProps = async () =&gt; {  const res = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/home-page`); // OK for dev and deploy  const homePage = await res.json();  return {    props: {      homePage,    },  };};",javascript
20939,"iOS Core Data when to save context? I'm having random crashes with core data due to concurrency and multithreading. I know that core data is not thread safe. I also found a couple other answers on how to create a ThreadedDataService and instantiate separate context for each thread. This is a bit too much for me to swallow at the moment, so I'm trying to find an easier way out.The solution that I'm trying at the moment is simple: saving data through the main thread. However, now a new issue arises: deadlock. The app becomes unresponsive because each of my insertions of a new NSManagedObject is followed by a call to save.

I obviously don't need a 1x image as my app does not support any non-retina devices. 2x seems reasonable for the iPhone 4s. Do I need Retina 4 2x if I provide 2x already?

Can you someone please guide me why it does work only for insert, not for update and delete even after enabling automaticallyMergesChangesFromParent? if it's the actual behavior, Is there any other way to solve my use case?The documentation (in NSManagedObjectContext.h) for .automaticallyMergesChangesFromParent says:  Whether the context automatically merges changes saved to its  coordinator or parent context.

Yes, those are already registered.I tested the same thing using NSFetchResultController it’s workinggood but unfortunately, I can’t use NSFetchResultController as Iuse a custom view to represent the dataAlso, I tried creating a new privateQueueConcurrencyType context and setting viewContext as a parent and it surprisingly started working so the issue is only while using newBackgroundContext() but as per document it should work properly as both are using same NSPersistentStoreCoordinatorThanks in advance!",ios

6850,"HTML video loop re-downloads video file I have an HTML5 video that is rather large. I'm also using Chrome. The video element has the loop attribute but each time the video ""loops"", the browser re-downloads the video file. I have set Cache-Control ""max-age=15768000, private"". However, this does not prevent any extra downloads of the identical file. I am using Amazon S3 to host the file. Also the s3 server responds with the Accepts Ranges header which causes the several hundred partial downloads of the file to be requested with the 206 http response code. Here is my video tag:&lt;video autoplay="""" loop="""" class=""asset current""&gt;    &lt;source src=""https://mybucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/myvideo.mp4""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;UPDATE: It seems that the best solution is to prevent the Accept Ranges header from being sent with the original response and instead use a 200 http response code.

38312,"How to create valid .app or .zip archive for automating iOS with Appium? When testing native Objective-C applications, Appium requires a valid .app package, or a .zip archived .app package, in order to run automation against with Instruments. But I'm doing something terribly wrong and running up against a brick wall in trying to just CREATE a valid .app package that Appium can actually run in the iOS emulator. I'm writing my automation in Java and using JUnit. Currently, in Xcode, I'm generating an .xarchive file for an ""iOS Device"" and then using the Xcode Organizer to show me where the .xarchive file has been placed. Once I find this archive I'm using ""show package contents"" to drill down into the .xarchive until I find the test.app package within the xarchive, which is greyed out and shows a circle/slash through the .app icon (yeah, I know, trouble...). I pull the test.app package from the .xarchive, and then place it in a directory with 777 write permissions. In my Java code (a Maven project using the Eclipse IDE) I write the capabilities like this, giving a full path to the test.app package:package com.my.appium._webdriver_test_demo;import java.net.URL;import org.junit.After;import org.junit.Before;import org.junit.Test;import org.openqa.selenium.By;import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;import org.openqa.selenium.WebElement;import org.openqa.selenium.remote.DesiredCapabilities;import org.openqa.selenium.remote.RemoteWebDriver;public class AppiumWebDriverTestBVTDemo {    private WebDriver driver;    @Before    public void setup() throws Exception    {        DesiredCapabilities cap = new DesiredCapabilities();        cap.setCapability(""device"", ""iPhone Simulator"");        cap.setCapability(""app"", ""/Users/wulf/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2013-05-31/Test/Products/Applications/test.app"");            driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL(""http://localhost:4723/wd/hub""), cap);    }       @After    public void tearDown() throws Exception    {        //Do stuff...    }}When running this code, whether or not an ""App path"" has also been given to the test.app package (just as done above) on the Appium interface, I get the following error in the Appium console:error: Could not parse plist file at /Users/wulf/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2013-05-31/Story/Products/Applications/test.app/Info.plisterror: Failed to start an Appium session, err was: Error: ENOENT, open '/Users/wulf/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2013-05-31/Story/Products/Applications/test.app/Info.plist'When I then take the same test.app package and zip it, and then change the code like so:cap.setCapability(""app"", ""/Users/wulf/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2013-05-31/Story/Products/Applications/test.app.zip"");I get the following error in the Appium console:error: Failed to start an Appium session, err was: Error: ENOENT, stat '/Users/wulf/Library/Developer/Xcode/Archives/2013-05-31/test.app.zip'And then when I place the same zipped test.app archive on a server (Ubuntu, Apache) and change my code like so:cap.setCapability(""app"", ""http://10.xxx.xxx.100/var/www/myGitRepo/myProject/test.app.zip"");I get the following error dialog in the Appium console:error: Test zip archive threw error Error: Command failed: error: Stderr: Archive:  /var/folders/gg/2_0flj7s51nd88kbtlwmm1qjxw981t/T/appium-app11353-39508-t2rmzq.zip  End-of-central-directory signature not found.

If so, how would this be specified in my capabilities code block?Do I need to generate a package with an .ipa extension and then do something fancy with that?Obviously, I'm a total newb when it comes to building .app packages in Xcode and could really use whatever help the good souls here can provide.

8429,"Conditionally change opacity of all nodes and edges recursively (d3) UPDATE: I have created a JSFiddle here. Please post an updated fiddle with your answer.I have dynamic filters that the user can apply to data but they change the opacity of the nodes to indicate what is filtered in and out (the filtered ""out"" elements are still partially visible and the actual d3 filter() function is not used (intentionally)). I also set a property on each node that is filtered out (e.g. node = {""name"": ""test"", ""isFilteredOut"": true};). So for the purposes of this question, even though I am using the word ""filter"", it is really just a conditional style change (and I will try to put the word ""filter"" in quotes in this post as a reminder of this).This all works fine, but now I want to recursively ""filter"" out all children nodes and edges of ""filtered-out"" nodes, and also the edge connecting the initial ""filtered-out"" node to its non-filtered-out parent node.All of the examples I can find begin with a click event and thus have the luxury of using this to get the data for the initial node selected. I do not have this luxury because the filter is applied using a UI element that is not within the graph itself.I currently ""filter"" the nodes like so:node.style(""opacity"", function(n) {    if (my_filter_conditions) {        return 1;    } else {        n.isFilteredOut = true;        return 0.1;    }});What I essentially need to do is:Recursively select all children nodes of currently ""filtered-out"" nodes and ""filter"" those out also (i.e. change their opacity to 0.1 and set n.isFilteredOut = true;).Change the opacity of all edges to 0.1 where the source node or target node are ""filtered out"" (i.e. n.isFilteredOut = true; on either end of the edge)What I triedI don't know how to access the data of the source and target nodes given only the index of each from the edges (remember I have no this node to start with from a click event). I tried passing the node index obtained from the edge to obtain the node data with:var node_data = d3.select(current_edge.source.index).datum();However, this resulted in errors from the d3 library related to this.node() being null (so passing the index here did not work).I also tried handling edges by nesting the function for handling links inside the function passed to the node.style() function but then it tries to deal with all edges on every node and I can't get it to provide the desired result.link.style(""opacity"", function (e) {    return ( (n.isFilteredOut)            &amp;&amp; (n.index==e.source.index | n.index==e.target.index) ) ? 0.1 : 1;});This was my attempt to ""filter out"" edges on both sides of ""filtered-out"" nodes, but none of the edges were ever filtered out when I used this for some reason (it appeared as if nothing happened at all).UPDATE: I have created a JSFiddle here.Notes on the fiddle:I'm aware that it is simplistic (it's supposed to be a minimum working example)The actual application contains filters that apply within types (even if just a search for a specific device/part/etc.), so it is important that the logic be able to conditionally follow the ""chain"" only for those nodes with node.isFilteredOut = true;In this example, the correct answer will result in creating a situation where filtering out devices will also filter out all partsSolutions that do any filtering using dataSet itself will not work, because much of my data is dynamically populated from various JSON sources. Feel free to work with nodes, edges, links, node, and/or link.Please do not rewrite my filtering methodology. Yes, I know eval() statements aren't great. But this is not a question about how to best apply infinite conjunctive filters, but about recursively changing the opacity of nodes and edges based on the filters applied",javascript

However, i lose the corner radius afterwards and the button goes back to a square.  How can I animate and change the transform scale while maintaining the circular button?I have also tried the following.  It restores the button back to circular state at the end of the animation, but there is a fraction of a second where it boxes back to a square at the very beginning of the animation and it looks pretty bad:[UIView animateWithDuration:0.1 delay:0.0 options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut animations:^{    self.layer.affineTransform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(0.0f, 0.0f);    self.layer.cornerRadius = 0.0f;    self.layer.masksToBounds = YES;    self.clipsToBounds = YES;} completion:^(BOOL finished) {    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.1 delay:0.0 options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseInOut animations:^{        self.layer.affineTransform = CGAffineTransformMakeScale(1.0f, 1.0f);        self.layer.cornerRadius = self.frame.size.width/2;        self.layer.masksToBounds = YES;        self.clipsToBounds = YES;    } completion:nil];}];EDIT:  I need the animation code and the rounding the button code, to all happen within the subclassed button.  It needs to happen internally from the button class when the button is touched (ie, no code for rounding the button or calling the animation can be in the view controller).EDIT WITH CLARIFIED SOLUTION:I have no idea why this worked, but a portion of the below suggestion seemed to fix the problem.  I was adding the animation method as an action on the custom button for UIControlEventTouchDown.  I removed the control event action and instead called the animation method from -(void)touchesBegan.... inside the subclassed button class and everything seems to be working fine.  Not sure why this happened.  Would love further clarification/explanation, in a comment or something, if someone knows why this worked.  Thanks again to @Shan for the help",ios
14057,"How to calculate FOV? Initial ContextI am developping an augmented reality application location based and I need to get the field of view [FOV] (I just update the value when the orientation change, so I am looking for a method which can get this value when I call it)The goal is to make a &quot;degree ruler&quot; relevant to reality like the following:I am already using AVCaptureSession to display camera stream ; and a path coupled with a CAShapeLayer to draw the ruler. This is working pretty good, but now I have to use Field of view value to place my element in the right place (choose the right space between 160° and 170° for example!).Actually, I am hardcoding these values with these sources : https://stackoverflow.com/a/3594424/3198096 (Special thanks to @hotpaw2!) But I am not sure they are fully precise and this is not handling iPhone 5, etc. I was unable to obtain values from official sources (Apple!), but there is a link showing values for all iDevice I think I need (4, 4S, 5, 5S) : AnandTech | Some thoughts about the iphone 5s camera improvements.Note: After personal test and some other research online, I am pretty sure these values are inaccurate! Also this forces me to use an external library to check which model of iPhone am I using to manually initialize my FOV... And I have to check my values for all supported device.###I would prefer a &quot;code solution&quot; !###After reading this post: iPhone: Real-time video color info, focal length, aperture?, I am trying to get exif data from AVCaptureStillImageOutput like suggested. After what I could be able to read the focal length from the exif data, and then calculate the horizontal and vertical field of view via formula!

27233,"-webkit-overflow-scrolling breaks absolute positioning I am building a page that needs to have some elements which stick to the top of the page when they would otherwise be scrolled off the screen. I managed to do this using position:absolute. Everything was working perfectly, but it needed momentum scrolling. I added -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch to the css of the scrollable area. This broke everything. My sticky elements with position:absolute are now just scrolling with the rest of the content. My question is this:Why does -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch affect absolute positioning, and is there a way around this?UPDATE: I added an alert whenever a child element becomes ""fixed"" or ""unfixed"". The alerts continue to fire, so the styling is still being applied, it just isn't working. This means that it's not a problem with keeping track of scroll position but rather a problem with the styling.UPDATE: I tried using position: fixed instead of position: absolute and -webkit-overflow-scrolling broke that tooUPDATE: After a lot of digging, I found references to this problem here and here.

However we are still new with this framework and we're having a hard time resolving some of what may seem to be straight forward.The model is pretty simple, there are 3 models: Queue, Task, and Image. We are using dynamic URI segments for all routes and routes for these models are nested in the form: :queue_id/:task_id/:image_id.The routes are configured this way:App.Router.map(function() {   this.resource('queue', {path: ':queue_id'}, function() {      this.resource('task', {path: ':task_id'}, function() {         this.resource('image', {path: ':image_id'});      });   });}And somewhere in the HTML, we have this simple template to iterate through all images from a task:{{#each task.images}}   &lt;li&gt;      {{#view App.ThumbnailView.contentBinding=""this""}}         &lt;img {{bindAttr src=""thumbnail.url""}} /&gt;      {{/view}}   &lt;/li&gt;{{/each}}And here is the code for the Thumbnail View:App.ThumbnailView = Ember.View.extend({   tagName : 'a',   click : function(e) {       var task = //assume this value exists;       var queue = //assume this value exists;       var image = //assume this value exists;       this.get('controller.target.router').transitionTo('image', queue, task, image);   }});Finally, here's is our ImageRoute:App.Image = Ember.Object.extend();App.Image.reopenClass({    find : function(image_id) {       //This is where I set a breakpoint       console.log(image_id);    }});App.ImageRoute = Ember.Route.extend({    model : function(params) {      //image_id is the last uri segment in: #/1/1/1      return App.Image.find(params.image_id);    }});The Problem:The call to this.get('controller.target.router').transitionTo() seems to be working. I can see that when I click in one of the thumbnails view, the URL changes (e.g from /1/1/2 to something like /1/1/3). However, I'm not seeing any state change in the UI. Also, the line where I put a breakpoint doesn't seem to be triggered. But when I refresh the page, it works well. Is there something wrong with my transition code?Thanks.",javascript

15641,"ASP.NET Application to authenticate to Active Directory or SQL via Windows Authentication or Forms Authentication I am in the process of writing an application that will need multiple forms of authentication.The application will need to support authentication to Active Directory, but be able to fail back to a SQL Membership Provider if the user is not in Active Directory.  We can handle the failing to the SQL Provider in code based on the username provided because the username will be a different format than the Active Directory username.Is this even possible?  What I mean is, can I use membership and use both ActiveDirectoryMembershipProvider and SqlMembershipProvider together or will I have to roll my own?Another additional added complexity is that I would like to automatically authenticate my internal users based of Windows Authentication back to AD, but use Forms Authentication for users not on our internal network, or users that are using the SQL Provider.These will most likely be separate servers, one internal, and the other external so I have a lot of planning to do to figure out the data replication, and how I will authenticate the AD users if they hit the outside server etc. I am wondering what thoughts are out there as I start down this road.  Is what I am wanting to do even possible without me rolling my own, or is there a way to mesh these together?Thanks for the reply.  The reason I asked originally was because I was able to get this specific senerio working about 7 years ago using IIS to authenticate and then passing back the credentials to a Lotus Domino Server Web App.  If the user was not authenticated via the Windows Authentication/ISS then Domino would handle the authentication.  This was what I was looking to do here, but really couldn't think of a way to make it work in IIS.As for the rest of your reply, I think you are on to the way that I will need to take.  I have thought this through and tossed it around in my head a lot.  The application will be somewhat different on the two servers anyway since there is going to be limited access to the data on the external server anyway.  The fact that so much is going to be different already I may just treat these as two applications, thus negating the need to use two types of authentication in the same application anyway.I am playing around with the idea already of writing my own authentication/login window for the external server, and if the user trys to log in with their AD credentials on the external server I will be able to detect that and redirect them to the internal server.  If they are not  on the local network or VPN'd in they will simply not get access.  This part still has some thought process to go though so I am not sure.As an additional thought - is there a way to pull just enough of AD into a SQL database to allow me to authenticate users to the SQL database from the external server using their AD credentials, without creating any security issues?  I hope I am clearly typing what I am thinking....Thanks again!Tim","asp.net,sql"

When you have a lot of code it becomes a mess to navigate it, which is why I use an IDE in the first place!And what worse: The editor never knows what functions objects have!The one possible solution I can see is to not to use enclosed namespaces, and to declare global variable before the define() call, but in this case all objects shall be called like UI_Message, AJAX_Requests.

47879,"Start playing sound in background on iOS? I'm trying to do something similar to Tile.app. When it shows a notification, it plays a sound. That seems simple enough-- use UILocalNotification and include the sound file name. But local notifications limit sounds to no more than 30 seconds, and Tile's sound keeps playing for a whole lot longer than that. I expect it's looping, and it continues until I can't stand the noise any more.The sound also plays even if the phone's mute switch is on, which doesn't happen with local notifications. For these reasons, UILocalNotification appears to be out.I thought maybe I could post a text-only local notification and have my app play the sound. But using AVAudioPlayer, the play method returns NO and the sound doesn't play.Other questions have suggested that this is by design, that apps aren't supposed to be able to play sounds from the background-- only continue sound that's already playing. I'd accept that reasoning except that Tile does it, so it's obviously possible. One suggested workaround violates Apple's guidelines in a way that I'm pretty sure Apple checks for now.Some details that may be relevant:I have the audio background mode in Info.plistI use AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback on the audio session, and the session should be active (at least, setActive:error: claims to succeed).This app uses Bluetooth but does not currently use the bluetooth-central background mode.",ios

I recently tried to create an object like this:var carousel = {      $slider: $('#carousel1 .slider'),      panes: carousel.$slider.children().length    };My intentions were to improve jQuery's selector performance by caching the results of $('#carousel1 .slider') in an object property, and to keep the code concise and relatively DRY.However, this didn't work. When the code executed, it threw an exception when trying to parse the value of panes, complaining that carousel was undefined.This makes sense, since I'd assume that carousel isn't fully declared until the assignment statement has been fully executed. However, I'd like to avoid resorting to this:var carousel = {};carousel.$slider = $('#carousel1 .slider');carousel.panes = carousel.$slider.children().length;That's not too much worse, but the carousel object will have several more properties that rely on the values of other properties, so that could quickly become verbose.I tried using this, but to no avail.

25660,"How to prevent simulated mouse events in mobile browsers? Mobile browsers simulate mouse events in order to support websites that only attach handlers to mouse events. However, if you want to implement two interaction models - one for mouse events, and one for touch events - then it's helpful to prevent the browser from simulating mouse events.On iOS Safari this is fairly straightforward - simply run preventDefault on touchend:jQuery(document).on('touchend', function(e) {  // Do some logic        e.preventDefault();});That's pretty sane. Unfortunately, neither Android's default browser nor Dolfin cancel mouse simulation using this technique. (Dolfin will cancel mousedown when preventDefault is run on touchstart - but that's not very helpful, because you don't know what action the finger will take on touchstart.)Is there some other way of conditionally, or even not conditionally, preventing simulated mouse events from firing?[EDIT]In order to begin to understand the problem(s) better, I've started a touch events compatibility table at: http://labs.cruncher.ch/touch-events-compatibility-table/",javascript

37604,Phantom.js / Casper.js with rotating proxy? I have a simple goal: load webpages with either phantom.js (out of the box) or casper.js (nice and easier) but using proxy and rotate it from a list if current one is bad (i.e. webpage loads fail or something like that).I know casper.js has --proxy param but it dictates the user to specify only ONE proxy and use it during runtime. Question #1 is: how to rotate proxy on the fly programmatically?I did some research and found this node-requester but it's not integrated with casper.js. I tried to extract out just the proxy feature in the code but didn't really understand how it works in the nutshell (I am not that smart I guess). So question #2: is there some simple implementation of proxy rotation that works with either phantom.js or casper.js? I prefer to use the fancy casper.js though but will go down with phantom.js bare as well.,javascript

I have to develop the same functionality as of this Pedometer AppI have observed this Pedometer app in very  high detail.It's not a perfect pedometer app. For example, if you stay/sit at one place and shake your hand, it also detects steps counts and distance.Ignore this ideal and gravity behavior, because in the instructions of this app it's already been mentioned that you should tie up your iPhone or you should place it in your pocket to count steps.This way, I have found this app working very well, it detects almost all steps.My problem is: I have developed one sample according to the above logic, but it's not working up to that level. For example, sometimes it detects 2-3 steps at the same time. And sometimes it works fine.My code:In viewDidLoad:[[UIAccelerometer sharedAccelerometer] setUpdateInterval:0.2] - (void)accelerometer:(UIAccelerometer *)accelerometer didAccelerate:(UIAcceleration *)acceleration {    const float violence = 1.2;    static BOOL beenhere;    BOOL shake = FALSE;    if (beenhere) return;    beenhere = TRUE;    if (acceleration.x &gt; violence || acceleration.x &lt; (-1* violence))       shake = TRUE;    if (acceleration.y &gt; violence || acceleration.y &lt; (-1* violence))       shake = TRUE;    if (acceleration.z &gt; violence || acceleration.z &lt; (-1* violence))       shake = TRUE;    if (shake) {       steps=steps+1;     }  beenhere = false;}What am I doing wrong?

41415,"Problem setting video frame rate using AVAssetWriter/AVAssetReader Situation:I am trying to export video with some parameters like video bit rate, audio bit rate, frame rate, changing video resolution, etc. Note that I am letting the user set the video frame rate in fractions; like user can set the video frame rate say, 23.98.I use AVAssetWriter and AVAssetReader for this operation. I use AVAssetWriterInputPixelBufferAdaptor for writing the sample buffers.Everything else works just fine, except the video frame rate.What I have tried:Setting the AVAssetWriter.movieTimeScale as suggested here. Which does change the video frame rate but also makes the video sluggish. (gist here)Setting AVVideoExpectedSourceFrameRateKey. Which does not help. (gist here)Setting AVAssetWriterInput.mediaTimeScale. Again, it changes the video frame rate but makes the video sluggish as AVAssetWriter.movieTimeScale does. The video shows different frames at some point and sometimes it sticks and resumes again. (gist here)Using AVAssetReaderVideoCompositionOutput and setting AVMutableVideoComposition.frameDuration; just like SDAVAssetExportSession does. Ironically with SDAVAssetExportSession code, the video is being exported just at the right frame rate that I want, but it just does not work in my code. gist hereI am not sure why it won't work with my code. The issue with this approach is it always returns nil from AVAssetReaderVideoCompositionOutput.copyNextSampleBuffer().Manually changing the timestamp of the frame with CMSampleTimingInfo, as suggested here Something like:var sampleTimingInfo = CMSampleTimingInfo()var sampleBufferToWrite: CMSampleBuffer?CMSampleBufferGetSampleTimingInfo(vBuffer, at: 0, timingInfoOut: &amp;sampleTimingInfo)sampleTimingInfo.duration = CMTimeMake(value: 100, timescale: Int32(videoConfig.videoFrameRate * 100))sampleTimingInfo.presentationTimeStamp = CMTimeAdd(previousPresentationTimeStamp, sampleTimingInfo.duration)previousPresentationTimeStamp = sampleTimingInfo.presentationTimeStamplet status = CMSampleBufferCreateCopyWithNewTiming(allocator: kCFAllocatorDefault, sampleBuffer: vBuffer,sampleTimingEntryCount: 1, sampleTimingArray: &amp;sampleTimingInfo, sampleBufferOut: &amp;sampleBufferToWrite)With this approach, I do get the frame rate set just right, but it increases the video duration (as mentioned in the comment of that question’s answer). I think at some point I may have to discard some frames (if the target frame rate is lower; I need to lower the frame rate in most of the cases).If I know that if I want 30fps, and my current frame rate is 60fps, it's simple to discard every second frame and setting the SampleBuffer time accordingly.If I go with this approach(i.e. setting 23.98 fps), how do I decide which frame to discard and if the target frame rate is higher, which frame to duplicate? Reminder: the frame rate could be in fractions.",ios

3591,"AngularJS NanoScroller after ng-repeat doesn't show I've been trough many posts on stackoverflow but I didn't manage to find the answer yet. I have a jQuery scrollbar plugin (nanoscroll), and I want it to update after a ng-repeat.As many posts here suggests, I've used a directive like this :myApp.directive(""postRender"", function() {    return function(scope, element, attrs) {        jQuery('.nano').nanoScroller({preventPageScrolling: true});    }});and then I have something like :&lt;div class=""nano""&gt; &lt;!-- my scrollable area --&gt;    &lt;div ng-controller=""MyController""&gt;        &lt;div ng-repeat=""item in items"" post-render&gt;        ...        &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;    Some content here...&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- my scrollable area --&gt;The problem is that (I have no idea why), if the content is just a little bit bigger than the available size for the .nano div then the scrollbar doesn't show.I believe that AngularJS doesn't wait to insert the content after the controller before trying to update nanoscroller and that this content is added after the posrt-render directive. By the way, I doubt that this problem comes from NanoScroller because when I hit F11 two times (full screen and back to normal mode), whithout any DOM modification, the scrollbar appears.Thanks,hilnius____ ANSWERFinally i found the solution. For those who wonder, it is necessary to use the $timeout service. Like that :myApp.directive('postRender',['$timeout', function (timer) {    return {        link: function (scope, elem, attrs, ctrl) {            timer(function () {                    jQuery('.nano').nanoScroller({preventPageScrolling: true})                 }                 , 0);        }    }}]);Altough I found a solution I'm still not aware of the issue that was there. I believe it's because the angular directive wasn't waiting for the DOM to be completely modified, maybe there were time concerns. ",javascript

How can I do that without the bind-xxx magic?Sure, bind-xxx is great, but there are cases when a non-standard behavior might be desired, built around a managed event handler like ChangeEvent.Updated, to compare, here's how I could have done it in React (try it online):function App() {  let [count, setCount] = useState(1);  const handleClick = () =&gt; setCount((count) =&gt; count + 1);  const handleChange = (e) =&gt; {    const userValue = e.target.value;    let newValue = userValue ? parseInt(userValue) : 0;    if (isNaN(newValue)) newValue = count;    // re-render even when count hasn't changed    setCount(newValue);   };  return (    &lt;&gt;      Count: &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;{count}&lt;/button&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      A: &lt;input value={count} onInput={handleChange}/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;/&gt;  );}Also, here's how I could have done it in Svelte, which I find conceptually very close to Blazor (try it online).&lt;script&gt;  let count = 1;  const handleClick = () =&gt; count++;  const handleChange = e =&gt; {    const userValue = e.target.value;    let newValue = userValue? parseInt(userValue): 0;    if (isNaN(newValue)) newValue = count;    if (newValue === count)      e.target.value = count; // undo user input    else      count = newValue;     }  };    &lt;/script&gt;Count: &lt;button on:click={handleClick}&gt;{count}&lt;/button&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A: &lt;input value={count} on:input={handleChange}/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Updated, to clarify, I simply want to undo whatever I consider an invalid input, retrospectively after it has happened, by handling the change event, without mutating the component's state itself (counter here).That is, without Blazor-specific two-way data binding, HTML native type=number or pattern matching attributes. I simply use the number format requirement here as an example; I want to be able to undo any arbitrary input like that.The user experience I want (done via a JS interop hack): https://blazorrepl.telerik.com/wPbvcvvi128Qtzvu03Surprised this so difficult in Blazor compared to other frameworks, and that I'm unable to use StateHasChanged to simply force a re-render of the component in its current state.","c#,asp.net"

Currently, I'm working to replace ""alert'/""confirm"" with the jquery dialog.But most of legacy codes is written in some asynchronous way, which make it difficult to change. Is there any way to make jquery dialog work in a synchronous way?  ( don't use loop  or callback function )   For example:   function run()   {       var result = confirm(""yes or no"");      alert( result );      \\more codes here   }In this example the alert and other codes will be executed after user's choice.If we use jquery dialogvar result = $dialog.open()It will continue to execute the alert, which is asynchronous.Currently, my solution is to use call back function in the OK|Cancel function.        For example:    OK: function ()   {       $dialog.close();       alert(""yes"");       //more codes here    }This method works but it is difficult to make all the synchronous codes become asynchronous,  which requires a lot of change (see the following example).

6280,"CoreML / MLModelConfig preferredMetalDevice - understanding device placement heuristics Is there any public document that clearly states CoreML's strategy for GPU device placement when running inference models on macOS? How does it decide if it should run on integrated, discrete or CPU? Can one reliably 'force' one path? How does this change for systems like the new Mac Pro with multiple discrete GPUs as well as multiple eGPU?My testing on my rMBP indicates the answer is no - and that temperature, battery, being plugged in to power, automatic graphics settings and app support and perhaps even some MLModel  architecture heuristic all play a role in device placement.Longer with context:Im curious if there is any public documentation on CoreML's device selection heuristic. With the addition of 10.15's CoreML preferredMetalDevice API for MLModelConfig, I imagined it would be possible to force the MTLDevice an MLModel / Vision request runs on.In my testing with integrated, discrete and eGPU on my 2018 rMBP with Vega 20, it appears only the eGPU consistently runs the CoreML model when requested.My CoreML Model is a pipeline model consisting of a MobileNet classifier with multiple outputs (multi head classifiers attached to a custom feature extractor).Im curious to understand device selection preference for a few reasons:a) I'd like to ensure my MLModel is fed images CIImages backed by MTLTextures local to the device inference will be run on, to limit PCI transfers and keep processing on a single GPU deviceb) My model is actually fed frames of video, and WWDC '19 / 10.15 introduces VideoToolbox and AVFoundation API's to help force particular video encoders and decoders on specific GPUs.In theory, if all works well, I should be able to specify the same MTLDevice for video decode, preprocessing, CoreML/Vision inference, and subsequent encoding - keeping all IOSurface backed CVPixelBuffers, CVMetalTextureRefs, MPSImages and friends resident on the same GPU.Apple has a Pro Apps WWDC video suggesting this is the path forward to fast path Multi GPU support / Afterburner decoder support moving forward.Does CoreML ACTUALLY allow suggested device placement to work?I am running a retina MacBook Pro 2018 with Vega 20 GPU, and trying various methods to get the Vega 20 to light up.Disabling automatic graphics switchingDisabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to FalseDisabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to TrueEnabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to FalseEnabling automatic graphics switching / setting NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching to Truehaving a full battery and plugged into my Apple power adaptorhaving full battery and plugged into my eGPUResults:I can reliably get the eGPU to run inference on my MLModel if I use MLModelConfig with preferredMetalDevice - every time.I can fairly reliably get the integrated GPU to run inference if I request it - but on occasion with some configurations of battery power, being plugged in, or automatic graphics switching options it doesn't run.I cannot reliably get the discrete GPU to run consistently on any above combination of configurations - but do see that all of my resources are resident on the GPU (textures etc), and see that CoreML is configured to run there. It just doesn't report any activity.I have configured my info.plist to have the proper eGPU support, and can hot plug / detect device changes and dispatch work to eGPUs, and also support detecting device removal requests. That all works. What doesn't is CoreML respecting my device placement!",ios

31083,Phonegap - automatically including correct cordova I'm developing a phonegap app on both iOS and android and have my www directory version controlled with git. I know that my HTML file needs to include the correct Cordova.js file (depending on which platform I'm currently developing on).It is a little annoying pulling changes to www on iOS when someone was working on android. It gives me the endless gap_poll alert.Simple solution is to remember to change the Cordova.js src so it points to the iOS version again. The problem with that is the other developers will need to keep changing their src if the latest commit was done on another platform.Is there a way to automatically detect which version of Cordova to include? That way it would work on any platform and we wouldn't have to make tedious changes.,"javascript,ios"

I need to know the coordinates of the intersecting point.The somewhat confusing (to me) mathematical but presumably accurate answer at Finding points on a rectangle at a given angle led me to try the following code, but it doesn't work properly. This question is similar to that one, but I'm looking for a corrected Objective-C / iOS method rather than a general mathematical response.I think a part of the code problem has to do with using the single 0 to 360 degree angle (in radians with no possibility of a negative number) input, but there are likely to be other problems.

4616,"Fastest modular exponentiation in JavaScript My problem is to compute (g^x) mod p quickly in JavaScript, where ^ is exponentiation, mod is the modulo operation. All inputs are nonnegative integers, x has about 256 bits, and p is a prime number of 2048 bits, and g may have up to 2048 bits.Most of the software I've found that can do this in JavaScript seems to use the JavaScript BigInt library (http://www.leemon.com/crypto/BigInt.html). Doing a single exponentiation of such size with this library takes about 9 seconds on my slow browser (Firefox 3.0 with SpiderMonkey). I'm looking for a solution which is at least 10 times faster. The obvious idea of using square-and-multiply (exponentiation by squaring, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring) is too slow for 2048-bit numbers: it needs up to 4096 multiplications.Upgrading the browser is not an option. Using another programming language is not an option. Sending the numbers to a web service is not an option.Is there a faster alternative implemented?Update: By doing some extra preparations (i.e. precomputing a few hundred powers) as recommended by the article http://www.ccrwest.org/gordon/fast.pdf mentioned in outis' answer below, it is possible do to a 2048-bit modular exponentiation using only at most 354 modular multiplications. (The traditional square-and-multiply method is much slower: it uses maximum 4096 modular multiplications.) Doing so speeds up the modular exponentiation by a factor of 6 in Firefox 3.0, and by a factor of 4 in Google Chrome. The reason why we are not getting the full speedup of 4096/354 is that BigInt's modular exponentation algorithm is already faster than square-and-multiply, because it uses Montgomery reduction (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_reduction).Update: Starting from BigInt's code, it seems worthwhile doing two levels of hand-optimized (and inlined) Karatsuba multiplication (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm), and only then revert to the base-32768 O(n^2) multiplication implemented in BigInt. This speeds up multiplications by a factor of 2.25 for 2048-bit integers. Unfortunately, the modulo operation does not become faster.Update: Using the modified Barrett reduction defined in http://www.lirmm.fr/arith18/papers/hasenplaugh-FastModularReduction.pdf and Karatsuba multiplication and precomputing powers (as defined in http://www.ccrwest.org/gordon/fast.pdf), I can get down the time needed for a single multiplication from 73 seconds to 12.3 seconds in Firefox 3.0. This seems to be the best I can do, but it is still too slow.Update: The ActionScript 2 (AS2) interpreter in the Flash Player isn't worth using, because it seems to be slower than the JavaScript interpreter in Firefox 3.0: for Flash Player 9, it seems to be 4.2 times slower, and for Flash Player 10, it seems to be 2.35 times slower. Does anybody know the speed difference between ActionScript2 and ActionScript3 (AS3) for number chrunching?Update: The ActionScript 3 (AS3) interpreter in Flash Player 9 isn't worth using because it has just about the same speed as the JavaScript int Firefox 3.0.Update: The ActionScript 3 (AS3) interpreter in Flash Player 10 can be up to 6.5 times faster than the JavaScript interpreter in Firefox 3.0 if int is used instead of Number, and Vector.&lt;int&gt; is used instead of Array. At least it was 2.41 times faster for 2048-bit big integer multiplication. So it might be worth doing the modular exponentiation in AS3, executing it in Flash Player 10 if available. Please note that this is still slower than V8, the JavaScript interpreter of Google Chrome. See http://ptspts.blogspot.com/2009/10/javascript-and-actionscript-performance.html for a speed comparison of various programming language and JavaScript implementations.Update: There is a very fast Java solution, which can be called from the browser's JavaScript if the Java plugin is installed. The following solution is about 310 times faster than the pure JavaScript implementation using BigInt.&lt;body&gt;hi0&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;document.body.innerHTML += '&lt;br&gt;hi1';if ('object'==typeof java) {  var x = new java.math.BigInteger(""123456789123456789"", 10);  var p = new java.math.BigInteger(""234567891234567891"", 10);  var g = new java.math.BigInteger(""3"", 10);  var v = x.modPow(x, p);  document.body.innerHTML += '&lt;br&gt;' + v.toString();  document.body.innerHTML += '&lt;br&gt;' + v.toString(16);} else {  document.body.innerHTML += '&lt;br&gt;java plugin not installed';}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;Can anyone translate this code to Silverlight (C#)?",javascript
10742,"UIView frames reset when using autolayout I'm facing an issue. I'm working on an app and I'm using storyboard with Autolayout enabled. Now on one of my UIViewControllers I have placed a UIView (say A). Now A has multiple subviews (UIViews to be precise). I have applied the ""Horizontally and Vertically centered"" constraint on A. The subviews inside A don't have any constraints on them.Now in my code I have a method for animating the subviews that are inside A. Inside that method I call the UIView's animation method...[UIView animateWithDuration: delay: options: animations: completion:];and animate one of the subview's inside View A. Now the problem is that these frame changes don't persist. When I modal a view controller on current view controller and then dismiss it the frames of all the subviews inside A get reset.I searched for it and found out the problem is occuring because of Autolayout. I disabled it and then tried again and everything worked well.But what is the workaround with Autolayout enabled...?Am I missing something...?The interesting thing is that many posts on StackOverflow suggested that   we should animate the constraints and NOT the frames when using autolayout. BUT I haven't applied any constraints on the subviews that are inside View A. Constraints are only applied on View A.Thanks.",ios
47598,XCTestCase to check if a method is called within a Struct I am trying to test a piece of code where I check to see if an account has already created a secret key and stored it in the keychain. If not it calls a method that starts the oauth process.My first thought was override the method which I would like to call if the user hasn't got a secret key. However I am using a struct and thus can't inherit and override the method.If I was using a class I would so something like: func testInitiateOauthCalledIfSecretKeyNotFound() {    class MockKeychainAccess: KeychainAccess {       var initiateAuthorizationWasCalled: Bool = false        override initiateAuthorization() {             initiateAuthorizationWasCalled = true        }    let keychainAccess = MockKeychainAccess()    keychainAccess.authorizeWithGoogle()    XCTAssertTrue(initiateAuthorizationWasCalled)}I haven't tested this code so not sure if it compiles. However logically it seems it would handle the case I am after. If within the authorizeWithGoogle method we call initiateAuthorization() then I would know that that has occurred. However one can not do this when they are using a struct as we can't inherit from a struct.Please note: I am new to TDD so maybe I am thinking about this the wrong way. Other suggestions are welcome. However I do not want to convert from a struct to a class just to write a test. I am using structs as I am trying to be more swift like.Does anyone know a way I could test whether a function is called within a struct?==========Edit:In response to dasdom answer I am adding an example of the general approach I am trying to achieve:override func viewDidLoad() {    setupView()    let api = DataApi()    getData(api)}func setupView() {    tableView.dataSource = tableViewDataSource}func getData(api: DataApi) {    api.getApplicationData( { (objects) in        if let applications = objects as?

6678,"Updating HTML via JSON/AJAX I've been using JSON to handle AJAX functionality in my rails applications ever since I heard about it, because using RJS/rendering HTML ""felt"" wrong because it violated MVC.  The first AJAX-heavy project I worked on ended up with 20-30 controller actions tied directly to specific UI-behaviors and my view code spread over controller actions, partials and rjs files.  Using JSON allows you to keep view specific code in the view, and only talk to view agnostic/RESTful controller actions via AJAX to get needed data.  The one headache I've found from using pure JSON is that you have to 'render' HTML via JS, which in the case of AJAX that has to update DOM-heavy elements, can be a real pain.  I end up with long string building code like// ...ajax success: function(records){  $(records).each(function(record){    var html = ('&lt;div id=""blah""&gt;' + record.attr +      etc +    ')  })}where etc is 10-15 lines of dynamically constructing HTML based on record data.  Besides of the annoyance, a more serious draw back to this approach is the duplication of the HTML structure (in the template and in the JS).*  Is there a better practice for this approach?(My motivation for finally reaching out is I am now tasked with updating HTML so complex it required two nested loops of Ruby code to render in the first place.  Duplicating that in Javascript seems insane.)One thing I've considered is loading static partial files directly from the file system, but this seems a bit much. ",javascript

44347,"How to return a PDF from a Web API application I have a Web API project that is running on a server. It is supposed to return PDFs from two different kinds of sources: an actual portable document file (PDF), and a base64 string stored in a database. The trouble I'm having is sending the document back to a client MVC application. The rest of this is the details on everything that's happened and that I've already tried.I have written code that successfully translates those two formats into C# code and then (back) to PDF form. I have successfully transferred a byte array that was supposed to represent one of those documents, but I can't get it to display in browser (in a new tab by itself). I always get some kind of ""cannot be displayed"" error.Recently, I made a way to view the documents on the server side to make sure I can at least get it to do that. It gets the document into the code and creates a FileStreamResult with it that it then returns as an (implicit cast) ActionResult. I got that to return to a server side MVC controller and threw it into a simple return (no view) that displays the PDF just fine in the browser. However, trying to simply go straight to the Web API function simply returns what looks like a JSON representation of a FileStreamResult.When I try to get that to return properly to my client MVC application, it tells me that ""_buffer"" can't be directly set. Some error message to the effect that some of the properties being returned and thrown into an object are private and can't be accessed.The aforementioned byte-array representation of the PDF, when translated to a base64 string, doesn't seem to have the same number of characters as the ""_buffer"" string returned in the JSON by a FileStreamResult.

45150,"Angular 2 - communication of typescript functions with external js libraries Using Javascript Infovis Toolkit as an external library for drawing graph and trees. I need to manipulate the onClick method of nodes in order to asynchronously sending an HTTP GET request to the server and assign the data that comes from server to the properties and variables of an Angular service class. By Using webpack for packing all the compiled typescripts to a single js file, the output file is confusing and unreadable. so calling a function which is in the compiled js file from an external js library, is not the best solution clearly.I try the following solution inside my Angular service so I can access to the properties of this service without any trouble:document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {    var nodes = document.querySelectorAll("".nodes""); // nodes = []    for (var i = 0; i &lt; nodes.length; i++) { // nodes.length = 0        nodes[i].addEventListener(""click"", function () {            // asynchronously sending GET request to the server      // and assing receiving data to the properties of this Angular service          });  }});However, this solution doesn't work because in Javascript Infovis Toolkit the nodes are drawn after finishing rendering of DOM and also after window.onload event. This library has some lifecycle methods such as onAfterCompute() which is called after drawing tree is completed.

The one-to-many relationship is an ordered relationship, creating an NSOrderedDataset.Now add a couple of buttons to the app; the first to create the data (a project and two associated 'drawings') and the second to swap the two drawings, then set a property within the first drawing.Here's the code...-(IBAction)onTestButton:(id)sender{    id delegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplication]delegate];    NSManagedObjectContext *managedObjectContext = [delegate managedObjectContext];    self.project = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@""Project"" inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext];    Drawing *drawing1 = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@""Drawing"" inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext];    Drawing *drawing2 = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@""Drawing"" inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext];    NSMutableOrderedSet* tempSet = [NSMutableOrderedSet orderedSetWithOrderedSet:self.project.drawings];    [tempSet addObject:drawing1];    [tempSet addObject:drawing2];    self.project.drawings = tempSet;    [self save];}-(IBAction)onTestButton2:(id)sender{    NSMutableOrderedSet *exchange = [self.project mutableOrderedSetValueForKey:@""drawings""];    [exchange exchangeObjectAtIndex:0 withObjectAtIndex:1];    self.project.drawings = exchange;    [self save];    Drawing *drawing = [self.project.drawings objectAtIndex:0];    BOOL current = [drawing.current boolValue];    drawing.current = [NSNumber numberWithBool:!current];    [self save];}-(void)save{    id delegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplication]delegate];    NSManagedObjectContext *managedObjectContext = [delegate managedObjectContext];    NSError *error = nil;    if( ![managedObjectContext save:&amp;error] )    {        NSLog(@""%@ Save: Unresolved Error on Save %@"", error, [error userInfo] );        abort();    }}Now, test by pressing the first test button. This sets up the data.Then press the second test button....all OK!!!Now press the second test button again and BANG.  You 'should get a NSMergeConflict error similar to this....  Save: Unresolved Error on Save {      conflictList =     (          ""NSMergeConflict (0x8a7d0b0) for NSManagedObject (0x8bedfa0) with objectID '0x8bd9340  ' with  oldVersion = 1 and newVersion = 2 and old object snapshot = {\n  current = \""\"";\n    project = \""0x8bc3f50  \"";\n}  and new cached row = {\n    current = \""\"";\n    project =  \""0x8aa88c0  \"";\n}""      );I notice from the error that my Project object has changed. However, this is a single thread app using the main app context.I've spent far too long on this and would appreciate someone else passing comment as to where the issue is. Is this a core-data bug, or am I being a right 'fool'?Many thanks/Fitto",ios

45312,"Starting CLLocationManager location updates while app is in background I'm building an app that uses CoreLocation for two purposes:First, monitoring beacon regions. Mostly we work with a specific hardware device that acts as a beacon and we track with CoreLocation the status of that beacon connection.Second, when the app detects a disconnection from the beacon device, we want to start a GPS process to locate where the disconnection happened.In most cases, the disconnection callback of the beacon device happens while the app is in background. Therefore the app must start the GPS tracking by calling -startUpdatingLocation while being in background.And this is the problem. iOS seems to not enable location background updates if the -startUpdatingLocation call happened in while the app was in background.Obviously, I have configured correctly background modes, NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription, set the property _locationManager.allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates to YES. The amazing thing: If I call -startUpdatingLocation while being in foreground and then I switch to background, location updates are sent correctly while being in background. However, when calling -startUpdatingLocation while being in background, then the application receives 2 or 3 location updates and then pauses forever.. until I manually bring back the application to the foreground, when location updates resumes and then keep working even if I switch the app to background again. Does anybody know or understand what should I do to fix this? or is it a major constraint of iOS? Because of the requirements of my app I really need to start locating updates while the app is in background (inside the callback of a beacon did exit region).Btw, if you want to reproduce this issue is very easy. Just create a blank project in Xcode and add this code to your default view controller. Remember to enable the background modes add a description to your info.plist  key ""NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription"".- (void)viewDidLoad {    [super viewDidLoad];    _locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init];    if (NSFoundationVersionNumber &gt; NSFoundationVersionNumber_iOS_8_3)        _locationManager.allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = YES;    _locationManager.delegate = self;    _locationManager.activityType = CLActivityTypeOther;    _locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest;    _locationManager.distanceFilter = kCLDistanceFilterNone;    [_locationManager requestAlwaysAuthorization];    // Creating a background task to delay the start of the startUpdatingLocation    __block UIBackgroundTaskIdentifier taskIdentifier = UIBackgroundTaskInvalid;    taskIdentifier = [[UIApplication sharedApplication] beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler:^{        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] endBackgroundTask:taskIdentifier];    }];    // Delaying the call to startUpdatingLocation 10 seconds, enough time to dismiss the application    dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(10 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{        [_locationManager startUpdatingLocation];        dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(1.5 * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{            [[UIApplication sharedApplication] endBackgroundTask:taskIdentifier];        });    });}Then, track the CLLocationManager delegate by doing some NSLogs and see what happens.Thanks,",ios

The page show date ""A"".User access Index again, and the browser shows the cached version.The page show date ""A"".Clean browser cache.User access Index again, and the browser shows the server cached version. The page show date ""A"".User clicks login, and the broswer gets a new page, that show date ""B"".User clicks logout, and the browser gets the server cached page. The page show date ""A"" again.But this is the behaviour so far:User access Index, and get the page from the server. The page show date ""A"".User access Index again, and the browser shows the cached version.The page show date ""A"".Clean browser cache.User access Index again, and the browser shows the server cached version. The page show date ""A"".User clicks login, and the broswer gets a new page, that show date ""B"".User clicks logout, and the browser should get the server cached page, but it does not. The page show date ""B"" again from the browser cache. This is because the lack of the Vary header in the authenticated response.I don't know if I get something wrong about caching, just missing some detail or the OutputCache does not work very well, but I would appreciate any guidance.Cheers.UPDATE 2:My intention is to use the HTTP cache semantics to:Allow browsers and proxys to cache the ""public"" version of the page.Allow browsers to cache the ""authenticated"" version of the page for its user.If I change the OutputCache declaration to do the caching only on the server and prevent the downstream and client caching:[OutputCache(Duration=60*5, Location=OutputCacheLocation.Server, VaryByCustom=""index"")]it behaves as expected, but the downstream and client cache is prevented, and that is not what I want.",asp.net

29247,"Are Java Applets unable to communicate with javascript within Firefox on Mac OS? I have a java applet running in a browser that is calling some javascript functions and expecting a result from theses functions. This is working with the following configurations :Internet ExplorerFireFox / WindowsSafari / MacBUT It's not working with Firefox on MAC OSThe source of the problem seems to be the win.eval calls that always return null.I tested this with Firefox 3.0.6 on a Mac OS X 10.4.11 A bit of code : JSObject win = (JSObject) JSObject.getWindow(this);Object exp = win.eval(""testfunc()"");System.out.println(""exp = "" + exp.toString());This triggers a java.lang.NullPointerException (exp.toString()) statement).The testfunc javascript function just returns true.I tried with win.call and got the same result.My applet tag includes the mayscript and scriptable attributes.I found the answer thanks to Tristan. Testing his solution I created a really simple test that could work and worked my way to find the culprit. I was sure I did my tests with an empty testfunc() that just returned true, but I probably didn't because in that case it DOES work.The real problem here was that the function called a public method of the applet. Liveconnect doesn't seem to be able to handle that case in Firefox Mac.Let me give you an example :Java class : public class MyApplet extends Applet {       public int getMyValue() {         return 5;     }     public void somefunction() {         JSObject win = (JSObject) JSObject.getWindow(this);         Object exp = win.eval(""jsfunc()"");         System.out.println(""exp = "" + exp.toString());     }}And the javascript code :function jsfunc() {    var myApplet = document.getElementById(""applet_id"");    return myApplet.getMyValue() + 5;}exp will be null in somefunction BECAUSE jsfunc calls the getMyValue() method of the applet. If you remove all calls to properties of the applet you're cool.To solve my problem I decided to give all the values of the applet that I neeeded as parameters of my javascript function and I'm good now.That may not be the case always, if the javascript changes the state of the applet ...I was lucky :)",javascript

33442,"How to hide events in fullCalendar? Using the latest version of fullCalendar (5.3.2) I want to hide some events that correspond to resources I don't want to show now in a given view. The standard way to do this is using an eventClassNames function to check for it and add a &quot;hidden&quot; class. Something like this:eventClassNames: function(arg) {   my_class = &quot;&quot;;   if (arg.view.type != 'resourceTimeGridDay') {      if (arg.event.extendedProps.real_rc != &quot;1&quot;) {         my_class = 'hidden';      }   }   return my_class;}using a simple CSS:.fc-event.hidden {  display: none;}This works fine, but has a problem when there is an overlap between a hidden event and a showed one. For instance in this case:events: [  {    title: 'Resource 1',    real_rc: '1',    start: '2020-12-22 16:00',    end: '2020-12-22 17:00'  },  {    title: 'Resource 2',    real_rc: '2',    start: '2020-12-22 15:00',    end: '2020-12-22 17:00'  }]Only event with real_rc == 1 should be displayed, and in fact it is right, but the space used by the hidden event is reserved as you can see in this image:If the event with the real_rc: 2 is ommited in the event list the result is the expected:I've used the Chrome DevTools to try to figure out what's happening and I think the problem is that the 'hidden' class is not set on the &quot;outermost event element&quot; as the fullCalendar states, but to a inner one:(first DIV is the first event and as you can see the hidden class is set but not to the DIV, but to the a tag)Here is a codepen to test it.IMHO this is a fullCalendar bug, but now I have a problem and I need a solution. My options are:Use a CSS selector for the parent &lt;-- IMPOSSIBLE: it doesn't exist (yet)Do (1) using jquery &lt;-- I DON'T KNOW HOW? I know I need to execute something like $(&quot;.fc-event.hidden&quot;).parent().remove() when the events are loaded and showed but since v3 nothing like this exists UPDATE and even if it exist, with the current v5 removing the DOM element doesn't resize the other event boxes.Try to repair the code of the library &lt;-- PROBLEMATIC: I don't want to worry about the patch if the next version of the library comes without a solutionFilter events on load &lt;-- SLOW: I use a callback function to load events through Ajax and I can do a fast filtering there, but in this case, I'll lose performance since I'll have to refetch events every time I need to show events with real_rc != 1Custom views &lt;-- I DON'T WANT TO REINVENT THE WHEEL.

40133,"Onedrive cors download in javascript I'm trying to process onedrive files in client-side javascript, but first I need a way to use XMLHttpRequest to download the file. Onedrive supports cors for a lot of operations, but for downloading the file into javascript there is the following problem:  As mentioned here: onedrive rest api manualI can send a request to:GET https://apis.live.net/v5.0/FILE_ID/content?access_token=ACCESS_TOKENand it will reply with a location header redirecting the browser to the file. The problem is when I send these requests through XHR, the browser always sends the Origin header with the request. For the first request I described above, onedrive also replies with an Access-Control-Allow-Origin:* header, so the request is allowed in the browser. However, when the browser is redirected to the actual location of the file, that resource does not have the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, so the XHR request is denied by the browser(chrome sends an Origin header set to null for the redirect request).  I've also tried getting the location but not redirecting automatically, and then sending another XHR request, this will set the origin header to the domain of my site, but the result is the same.  As I mentioned in the beginning, I need to process the data in javascript, so I'm not asking about how to download onedrive files to hard drive. I need the data to be accessible by javascript in the webpage.I know that I can use server side programming to get the file data for me and then send it to the client, but for my application this is not an option(at least this is not what I'm asking for at the moment).If there is no way to do this, does anyone have an idea why they would implement their api this way? To allow javascript to get the location through cors and redirect but not include a cors header for the redirected resource. Why not just deny cors in the first place? Is this a bug?",javascript

18788,"Lift, Play! or BlueEyes (with a bunch of Javascript Frameworks) I find myself in a bit of a conundrum. I'm building a new, modern, web-based application and not only do I have to pick a technology, I have to pick an architecture. I think it is fair to say that these days its a tough choice because we have more options than we did even 5 years ago.First things first, I've made the decision that Scala will be the server-side language. I have my reasons, and this is not a Scala versus XYZ post - that choice has been made. I've also sucummed to the fact that we're on the web, in the cloud, so I'm not even going to try and get away from Javascript.  Maybe I will with CoffeeScript, but I will be writing Browser-hosted code.Now, assuming Scala, most people would probably jump to either Play! or Lift. Probably Play! given it's endorsement from Typesafe, but I think I have another more important question that needs answering first. What's the architecture? If I want a very rich client, do I really need more than a simple stateless service layer based on the fact that we'll have a tonne of Javascript anyway? I'm not sure it'll be a single-page webapp, but is something like BlueEyes potentially the right choice? Lift and Play! are much more heavyweight in that they take on much more responsibility. They generate the HTML and for these frameworks, the browser is pretty dumb. Things like routing, validation, Ajax and Comet support are all server-side concerns. Because the browser is more capable today, rich, interactive features are normally implemented by generating and injecting Javascript from the server.My question boils down to this. Do I go with a traditional Lift/Play! framework where the server takes on both the client and server responsibility or do I go with a rich client + REST-style service layer where the client takes a more prominent role in the application? An architecture where the client deals with routing, validation, binding, etc. I'm seeing frameworks like KnockOut.js, Sammy.js, Sproutcore, Backbone.js,... I'm not going to list them all but suffice to say that they all take on some of these framework features from a client-side perspective.If I choose Play!, am I giving up some of that rich UI? What about situations where I want to provide service API's for integration/mashup/mobile purposes? How would Play! help me here? Clearly BlueEyes plays well here. I think I need a service layer regardless.If I choose BlueEyes, what does my client code look like? How many of these Javascript-based frameworks do I need to give me what I need? I still want most of my business-logic in my service layer, but routing, binding.. all that UI stuff would be a concern of the client.I'm not sure there is a right or wrong answer, but I think this community can probably point me in the right direction.I also posted this to my blog at http://www.andyczerwonka.com/picking-a-web-technology-isnt-as-easy-as-it-u-45228",javascript

18723,"Forwarding UIGesture to views behind I am working on an iphone (iOS 4.0 or later) app and having some troubles with touch handling between multiple views. I am having a view structure like this---&gt; A superView      |     ---&gt; SubView - A      |     ---&gt; SubView - B (exactly on top of A, completely blocking A).Basically I have a superView, and sibling subviews A and B. B has the same frame as A, hence hiding A completely. Now my requirement is this. SubView B should receive all swipe and tap (single and double)gestures.SubView A should receive all pinch gestures.This is how I added gesture recognizers to the viewsUISwipeGestureRecognizer *leftSwipe  =  [[UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc]initWithTarget:self action:@selector(leftSwipe:)];[leftSwipe setDirection:(UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionLeft)];leftSwipe.delegate  =   self;[bView addGestureRecognizer:leftSwipe];[leftSwipe release];UISwipeGestureRecognizer *rightSwipe  =  [[UISwipeGestureRecognizer alloc]initWithTarget:self action:@selector(rightSwipe:)];[rightSwipe setDirection:(UISwipeGestureRecognizerDirectionRight)];rightSwipe.delegate   =   self;[bView addGestureRecognizer:rightSwipe];[rightSwipe release];UIPinchGestureRecognizer *pinch   =  [[UIPinchGestureRecognizer alloc]initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handlePinch:)];pinch.delegate    =   self;[aView addGestureRecognizer:pinch];[pinch release];I did some research and to me UIGestureRecognizerDelegate looked promising and I implemented the delegate method- (BOOL)gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizerI returned NO for SubView B, hoping that underlying view will get these event. No such luck though- (BOOL)gestureRecognizerShouldBegin:(UIGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer{    if ([gestureRecognizer isKindOfClass:[UIPinchGestureRecognizer class]] &amp;&amp; [gestureRecognizer view] == bView) {        NSLog(@""pinchGesture"");        //bView.userInteractionEnabled = NO;        return NO;    }    return YES;}Then I disabled user interaction of SubView B inside the delegate callback (commented code in above block), when pinch gesture is recognized, hoping remaining part of gesture will be received by SubView A. No such luck there too.. So that is where I stand now. I have seen this question, where the accepted answer involves property cancelsTouchesInView. But I believe cancelsTouchesInView only cancel a particular touch event, do not forward it. Any other way to achieve my requirement? I am ready to work on whatever hint you provide.EDIT : BOUNTY TIMEMy so called subView A is actually an instance of a 3rd party library's View class, which takes all touches away and I don't have any control over any gestures on it. I want different implementation for left and right swipe and I want pinch, tap etc work just like it is working with this third party view. So I put a view on top of A (SubView B) to get left and right swipes. But now I want to forward other gesture events to underlying library.",ios
21776,"HTML5 Canvas (game) on iPad / Android tablets While attempting to make a game using Canvas I noticed a few quirks on tablet / phone browsers.1) How do I disable the Canvas from being selectable? It seems like when the user touches it, it highlights the canvas, and almost makes an attempt to select it. This is undesired.2) Browser slide gestures. Some browser have slide gestures that override any movement capturing done in the canvas or webpage. This is extremely annoying and undesired as well.3) Canvas control with HTML UI elements. I noticed when there is a canvas present with fellow ui elements (such as text) sometimes clicking or dragging in the canvas will highlight a part of the HTML and instead drags the HTML elements instead of hitting the canvas.Any help is greatly appreciated! I was hoping HTML5 would be mature enough to allow for good compatibility on mobile as well as desktop. The idea is to be able to code once and play everywhere....thanks!",javascript

11025,"AVAssetExportSession fails - Merging 2 WAV files (iOS7) I am attempting to merge 2 WAV files, using an AVAssetExportSession, under iOS7.  I've confirmed the files are there and don't seem to be corrupt or anything.  These are WAV files that were taken from recordings done from the device itself, and they are relatively small files.  When it calls the exportAsync method, it fails immediately with an ""Operation Stopped"" error immediately in the completion block (reason description is: ""The operation is not supported for this media"").  This happens in the simulator and the device itself.  See below for my exporting code:NSError *avError = nil;NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager];AVURLAsset *tmpAsset = [[AVURLAsset alloc] initWithURL:_tmpRecordingUrl options:@{AVURLAssetPreferPreciseDurationAndTimingKey: @YES}];AVURLAsset *permAsset = [[AVURLAsset alloc] initWithURL:_url options:@{AVURLAssetPreferPreciseDurationAndTimingKey: @YES}];AVMutableComposition *composition = [AVMutableComposition composition];[composition insertTimeRange:CMTimeRangeMake(kCMTimeZero, permAsset.duration) ofAsset:permAsset atTime:kCMTimeZero error:&amp;avError];[composition insertTimeRange:CMTimeRangeMake(kCMTimeZero, tmpAsset.duration) ofAsset:tmpAsset atTime:CMTimeMakeWithSeconds(_positionSlider.value, 1) error:&amp;avError];AVAssetExportSession *export = [[AVAssetExportSession alloc] initWithAsset:composition presetName:AVAssetExportPresetPassthrough];if ([fileManager fileExistsAtPath:[_workingUrl path]]) {    [fileManager removeItemAtURL:_workingUrl error:&amp;avError];}export.outputFileType = AVFileTypeWAVE;export.outputURL = _workingUrl;[export exportAsynchronouslyWithCompletionHandler:^(void) {    // fails}];I've also confirmed that the ""avError"" never gets populated, so there doesn't seem to be an issue with inserting the timeRanges or creating the export session.  I did a check on the assets, and they are both readable, playable, and exportable (per the bool values on the obj).Am I missing something obvious here?  This code works fine with iOS6.  Feel free to let me know if I need to provide more info, and thanks in advance for any direction you can offer!EDIT #1:  I tried adding in the track mechanism, similar to what this post has: AVAssetExportSession - Join 2 mp4 files in IOS, but no luck there, same issue.  Also, if needed to know, the same error occurs when I switched to from WAV to CAF. Here is what I get when I print out the supportedFileTypes for when trying to use any audio-type format:(""com.apple.quicktime-movie"",""com.apple.m4a-audio"",""public.mpeg-4"",""com.apple.m4v-video"",""public.3gpp"",""org.3gpp.adaptive-multi-rate-audio"",""com.microsoft.waveform-audio"",""public.aiff-audio"",""public.aifc-audio"",""com.apple.coreaudio-format"")Since the audio formats are in there, and the exporter is returning YES for both assets being exportable, playable, and readable, I see no reason why it would fail with this kind of error.EDIT #2: Some additional info - even when I strip the code down to its bare minimum, just creating an AVAsset from an NSURL, then feeding it to the AVAssetExportSession with the passthrough preset, it still just fails in iOS7.  There has to be something I'm missing here.  I tested this SAME code with video (mp4) files, and it works perfectly in iOS7.  I took the same code and adjusted it for WAV, CAF, and M4A files, and it failed every time with a ""The operation is not supported for this media."" error.Is this a bug in Apple's code, or are we even able to do this with audio files anymore with iOS7?  I don't see anything specifically about this in Apple's AV Foundation section of the ""What's New in iOS7"" documentation, and in iOS6, this seems to work fine.  I am probably going to engage Apple on this.",ios

From there I added my love and affection and used Export Template. The zip lands in My Documents &gt; Visual Studio 2013 &gt; My Exported Templates. If you have Visual Studio install the template for you, a duplicate zip is placed within My Documents &gt; Visual Studio 2013 &gt; Templates &gt; ProjectTemplates. Here's where the problem begins...Issue:In Visual Studio the template is found within the Visual C# tree branch, not a custom template within the ASP.NET Web Application template. Bummer. Even more odd, the template installs only to C# and not to its Web sub-folder. MSDN documentation online mentioned a &lt;ProjectSubType&gt; within the .vstemplate file, which was empty when I investigated, but even explicitly adding Web did not change the UI location. This nothing to do with my goal really, but it seems to suggest that VS2013 does not honor some of the XML within .vstemplate?More Info:I started digging through the Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\IDE\ProjectTemplates\ and one of the oddball things I noticed was two separate ""folder trees"": {root}\Web\CSharp\1033 and {root}\CSharp\Web\1033. The first tree held WebTemplate45 and its project WebApplication45Dev12.vstemplate illustrating the ProjectType and ProjectSubtype values mentioned above. Mimicing this did not change aything.The second tree also held a WebTemplate45 with WebTemplate.vstemplate included. This one was was significantly different because its Type=ProjectGroup and it referenced a TemplateGroupID and curious WizardExtension tag that referenced the OneASPNetProjectTemplateWizard. My guess is this is the daddy template that displays those showen in the image displayed. Question(s)What does it take to deliver a project package in the ""One ASP.Net"" popup? Registry alterations? VSIX?If it is not possible, is there anyway to clone the daddy window for all custom projects?

39546,"Performance Issues When Using Many CALayer Masks I am trying to use CAShapeLayer to mask a CALayer in my iOS app as it takes a fraction of the CPU time to mask an image vs manually masking one in a bitmap context;When I have several dozen or more images layered over each other, the CAShapeLayer masked UIImageView is slow to move to my touch.Here is some example code:UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle]pathForResource:@""SomeImage.jpg"" ofType:nil]];CGMutablePathRef path = CGPathCreateMutable();CGPathAddEllipseInRect(path, NULL, CGRectMake(0.f, 0.f, image.size.width * .25, image.size.height * .25));for (int i = 0; i &lt; 200; i++) {    SLTUIImageView *imageView = [[SLTUIImageView alloc]initWithImage:image];    imageView.frame = CGRectMake(arc4random_uniform(CGRectGetWidth(self.view.bounds)), arc4random_uniform(CGRectGetHeight(self.view.bounds)), image.size.width * .25, image.size.height * .25);    CAShapeLayer *shape = [CAShapeLayer layer];    shape.path = path;    imageView.layer.mask = shape;    [self.view addSubview:imageView];    [imageView release];}CGPathRelease(path);With the above code, imageView is very laggy. However, it reacts instantly if I mask it manually in a bitmap context:UIImage *image = [UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle]pathForResource:@""3.0-Pad-Classic0.jpg"" ofType:nil]];CGMutablePathRef path = CGPathCreateMutable();CGPathAddEllipseInRect(path, NULL, CGRectMake(0.f, 0.f, image.size.width * .25, image.size.height * .25));for (int i = 0; i &lt; 200; i++) {    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(CGSizeMake(image.size.width * .25, image.size.height * .25), NO, [[UIScreen mainScreen]scale]);    CGContextRef ctx = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();    CGContextAddPath(ctx, path);    CGContextClip(ctx);    [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(-(image.size.width * .25), -(image.size.height * .25), image.size.width, image.size.height)];    UIImage *finalImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();    SLTUIImageView *imageView = [[SLTUIImageView alloc]initWithImage:finalImage];    imageView.frame = CGRectMake(arc4random_uniform(CGRectGetWidth(self.view.bounds)), arc4random_uniform(CGRectGetHeight(self.view.bounds)), finalImage.size.width, finalImage.size.height);    [self.view addSubview:imageView];    [imageView release];}CGPathRelease(path);By the way, here is the code to SLTUIImageView, it's just a simple subclass of UIImageView that responds to touches (for anyone who was wondering):-(id)initWithImage:(UIImage *)image{    self = [super initWithImage:image];    if (self) {        self.userInteractionEnabled = YES;    }    return self;}-(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{    [self.superview bringSubviewToFront:self];}-(void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{    UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject];    self.center = [touch locationInView:self.superview];}Is it possible to somehow optimize how the CAShapeLayer is masking the UIImageView so that the  performance is improved? I have tried to find out where the bottle-neck is using the Time Profiler in Instruments, but I can't tell exactly what is causing it. I have tried setting shouldRasterize to YES on both layer and on layer.mask but neither seem to have any effect. I'm not sure what to do.Edit:I have done more testing and find that if I use just a regular CALayer to mask another CALayer (layer.mask = someOtherLayer) I have the same performance issues. It seems that the problem isn't specific to CAShapeLayer—rather it is specific to the mask property of CALayer. Edit 2:So after learning more about using the Core Animation tool in Instruments, I learned that the view is being rendered offscreen each time it moves. Setting shouldRaster to YES when the touch begins and turning it off when the touch ends makes the view stay green (thus keeping the cache) in instruments, but performance is still terrible. I believe this is because even though the view is being cached, if it isn't opaque, than it still has to be re-rendered with each frame.One thing to emphasize is that if there are only a few views being masked (say even around ten) the performance is pretty good. However, when you increase that to 100 or more, the performance lags. I imagine this is because when one moves over the others, they all have to be re-rendered. My conclusion is this, I have one of two options. First, there must be someway to permanently mask a view (render it once and call it good). I know this can be done via the graphic or bitmap context route as I show in my example code, but when a layer masks its view, it happens instantly. When I do it in a bitmap context as shown, it is quite slow (as in it almost can't even be compared how much slower it is). Second, there must be some faster way to do it via the bitmap context route. If there is an expert in masking images or views, their help would be very much appreciated.",ios

43013,"Developing apps for multiple iOS version I am testing an app on an iPhone 4 with iOS 5.1 and an iPad 4 with iOS 6.0. I looked around and surprisingly did not find similar questions:1- My app has some methods that have been deprecated in iOS 6.0 so I believe I have to build some if/then conditions to test for system version using: [[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion], and then use the version appropriate methods. Is that the most efficient way?2- My understanding is, with only one target, the ""project"" Deployment Target and the ""Targets"" deployment target serve the same purpose. And I need to have one of them or both as iOS 5.1 since that is the minimum iOS supported. What is confusing is that if the target is built based on iOS 5.1, how would it run on the iPad4 with iOS 6.0:Does the iPad OS checks for target versions before running or just tries to run the code and it happens that the iOS 5.1 target does not have any code that the 6.0 is incompatible with?Even if that is the case though, how could a 5.1 target support 6.0 methods that I built to conditionally replace deprecated methods?

45516,"When is it appropriate to use Core Animation over UIView animation in common cases This is related to a lot of little bugs that might stereotypically be considered minor by one person, but major by another.What I've noticed more and more, is that when using all flavors a UIView animateWithDuration:, it actually modifies things unnecessarily, such multiple properties of my views', to do a simple hide/reveal style animations, etc..Things seem to be finicky in scenarios like a UINavigationBar not animating into position properly for a certain rotation transition, or a header view not animating along with the status bar when it's frame updates, when when a view's sublayers would implicitly animate differently when their parent view's properties change...So many of these I have been revisiting, and converting to CAAnimations because they seem to be easier to manage, in they do not actually modify my views' target property values.A simple example being, using [view setHidden:], and then animating it or out of view, but the view is actually already visible or hidden while the animation runs.Another one being, the need to transform/rotate/scale a UINavigationController's view, and using a CAAnimation to do it, because the UINavigationBar does not move to it's correct position if I modify the UINavigationController's view, and any of it's parent view's transform property values.So in conclusion to this question, I have been back and forth, and have been finding places where one is more appropriate than the other for my circumstances, but mainly, I want to hear what others think about these scenarios, and if there's is some insight into what Apple has provided that I can feel better about my approaches.Thanks in advance.",ios

21789,"IE7 and IE8 randomly not able to load external script I am dynamically adding &lt;link&gt; elements to the head once the DOM is ready. However, I'm getting inconsistent results in IE8 and IE7 (all other browsers are fine).Every few times the page is loaded (cached or uncached), IE 7/8 will drop a handful of CSS rules in the stylesheets. 1 or 2 of my dynamic stylesheets will not load. It's always the same 1 or 2 stylesheets that IE tends to ignore - even though the Developer Toolbar shows them as added to the head!.The stylesheets themselves show up as &lt;link&gt; elements in the final DOM, but some of their rules are not applied (although every few reloads they are applied, without any issue).In my position, I do not have the luxury of writing code from the &lt;head&gt; (CMS restriction) - I can only dynamically insert from the body, which may be the issue.UPDATED: This is the code I am using (located within the &lt;body&gt;) to insert stylesheets:document.observe('dom:loaded', function() { // Using Prototype.js// Add stylesheets// addStylesheet('cite.css', 'head'); // Contains no webfont/@font-face rules// addStylesheet('type.css', 'head'); // Contains webfont family name references*// addStylesheet('flex.css', 'head'); // Responsive rules with @media queries// addStylesheet('anm8.css', 'head'); // Some minor positional CSS for home page// addStylesheet('gothic-cite.css', 'head'); // *Contains @font-face config// addStylesheet('stag-cite.css', 'head'); // *Contains @font-face configaddStylesheet('all.css', 'head'); // Contains ALL content from above in 1 filefunction addStylesheet(cssname, pos2){    var th2 = document.getElementsByTagName(pos2)[0];    var s2 = document.createElement('link');    s2.setAttribute('type', 'text/css');    s2.setAttribute('href', cssname);    s2.setAttribute('media', 'screen');    s2.setAttribute('rel', 'stylesheet');    th2.appendChild(s2);}});As suggested, even when I combined all rules into one stylesheet (which I hate doing), IE 7/8 continues to flip-flop as described with some rules, and the page appears differently.As a further check, I also removed all @font-face and referenced font-family: ""webfont-name"" rules from the stylesheets, and the same behavior continued. Therefore, we can rule out webfonts being the issue.You can see the anomalies by visiting the following with IE8 and refreshing/clicking the nav several times. It seems completely random as to when IE8 is dropping those styles. However, in the natively-built control page, all styles load correctly, every time.Live Page (with problems)https://www.eiseverywhere.com/ehome/index.php?eventid=31648&amp;tabid=50283PHP-based CMS prints out XHTML on page load (template content mixed w/user content)Prototype.js is loaded and initialized by default on page loadCMS proprietary scripts.js file is parsed on page loadMy scripts run when DOM is loaded, essentially replacing body.innerHTML CMS fluff-HTML with just the HTML I want, then adds stylesheets to &lt;head&gt;.For lte IE 8, CSS extension plugins (selectivizr.js, html5.js, and ie-media-queries.js) are loaded within the &lt;body&gt; via conditional comments. Not sure if they wait for DOM:loaded...The CMS WYSIWYG editor converts all carriage-returns to empty &lt;p&gt; tags, resulting in elements like &lt;section&gt; being contained inside broken &lt;p&gt; tags, and extra &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; tags being created where whitespace is expected. Only lt IE 8 seems to choke on this, however, so I added the following CSS rules to remedy this::not(.ie7) p { display: none; }.ie7 p { display: inline; }article p { display: block !important; }I should note that the external stylesheets here are being pulled from the same domain, but each time they are re-uploaded, a new MD5-based URL is generated for the file. I'm not sure if previous revisions to the file (or previous files) are still available by their previous URLs. This isn't likely to be the problem though, since the newly created all.css stylesheet is still dropping rules that have been in the file from the start.Control Page (works flawlessly)http://client.clevelanddesign.com/CD/IDG/CITE/home.htmlPure XHTML document - no PHP.jQuery is used, rather than Prototype, for IE8 and below.All resources (stylesheets) are present in &lt;head&gt; at page load - no dynamic insertionFor lte IE 8, CSS extension plugins (selectivizr.js, html5.js, and ie-media-queries.js) are initialized natively.Rephrased question:Which of these differences do you think may be causing IE 7/8 to flip-flop on styles when loaded on the Live page? I personally suspect either a race-condition issue, or that Prototype.js and the other CMS scripts are mucking things up (unfortunately no way to purge those from the page though).PS: I've already tried using IE's createStylsheet() function, to no avail.UPDATE - Screenshots of working/not working in IE8IE8: DOM code when loaded correctly:IE8: DOM code when NOT loaded correctly:",javascript

Sometimes there's a few days in between, while other times there are multiple errors per day.The exception is not limited to one site in particular, though they share business and data access assemblies. The error seems to always be thrown from SqlClient.TdsParser.Run(). It sometimes is thrown from old-school direct SqlCommand.Execute() calls, while other times it is thrown from Linq2Sql code.I've been assured by the network guys that there are no errors or packets lost on their end. Has anyone else experienced this? Could it be a driver problem? We have been unable as of yet to pinpoint a specific trigger for this exception.We're running II6 on Windows Server 2003.",asp.net
10240,"Security approach in web application I am designing a web application in ASP.NET / C# where each registered user has the ability to add/modify/delete rows based on their user-id. Take this example:I am going to edit my route on the page /route.aspx?routeid=854 which belongs to me (user-id: 1).But because I am a curious guy I try to access /route.aspx?routeid=855 which belongs to another user (user-id: 2).How can I best avoid people from accessing other peoples data? Should I send each user id (from session) with each database-call, should I validate user/password on every page load or what is the best and most secure approach?I hope I made this clear enough.","c#,asp.net"

19134,"Are complex indexes possible when using Core Data? I'm working on an iOS flash-card style learning app that, on load, needs to grab a bunch of data from Core Data. But the data I need is a fairly specific subset of the entity, based on user settings, so there are multiple predicates involved testing equivalence. I'm finding these fetches are super slow and, based on research on SQLite, I think an index would be a good choice here.Now, I understand (largely from reading other stackoverflow questions) that SQLite and Core Data are two different, basically orthogonal things that should not be confused. But it's also my understanding that you're supposed to work through Core Data to do any sort of database work and tweaking; you shouldn't try to bypass and work directly with SQLite when optimizing or designing object permanence in your app.But the only thing I can find for indexes in Core Data is that one ""indexed"" checkbox for each attribute in a model. And that's just not doing the sort of optimization I'm looking for.Here's the fetch request, currently:NSFetchRequest *fetchRequest = [[NSFetchRequest alloc] init];NSEntityDescription *entity = [NSEntityDescription entityForName:@""SKUserItem"" inManagedObjectContext:context];fetchRequest.entity = entity;NSSortDescriptor *sortDescriptor = [[[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@""next"" ascending:YES] autorelease];fetchRequest.sortDescriptors = [NSArray arrayWithObject:sortDescriptor];NSMutableArray *predicates = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:6];[predicates addObject:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""next &lt; %f"", now() + (60.0*60.0*24.0)]];[predicates addObject:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""next &gt; %f"", nextOffset]];[predicates addObject:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""user == %@"", user]];[predicates addObject:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""langRaw == %d"", lang]];NSArray *stylePredicates = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""styleRaw == %d"", SK_SIMP_AND_TRAD], [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""styleRaw == %d"", self.style], nil];[predicates addObject:[NSCompoundPredicate orPredicateWithSubpredicates:stylePredicates]];if([self.parts count] == 4 || (self.lang == SK_JA &amp;&amp; [self.parts count] == 3))    ;  // don't have to filter by parts; they're studying all of themelse {    NSMutableArray *partPredicates = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:[self.parts count]];    for(NSString *part in self.parts)        [partPredicates addObject:[NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@""partRaw == %d"", partCode(part)]];    [predicates addObject:[NSCompoundPredicate orPredicateWithSubpredicates:partPredicates]];}NSPredicate *compoundPredicate = [NSCompoundPredicate andPredicateWithSubpredicates:predicates];fetchRequest.predicate = compoundPredicate;So essentially what this fetch does is sort by next (the time when the given item is due) and filter for username, language being studied, the style being studied (in Chinese there's simplified and traditional) and the parts being studied (writing, tone, reading, or definition), and only fetching within a ""next"" range. Here's a short list of things I've learned from tweaking and fiddling with this:It always scans the whole table, or seems to. Though next is indexed, even if I force it to search a range which I know will return nothing, it still takes several seconds for the fetch to complete.The predicates, any number of predicates, makes this slow. If I remove some but not all, it's about as slow. If I remove all predicates (thus breaking the app) then it's much faster.The speed is heavily dependent on how many UserItems there are total in the table. The more items there are, the slower this is. Some people can have tens of thousands of items, and that's when this fetch can take as much as 10 seconds to complete. This is leading to awkward pauses in my app.The upper bound on the next value was added not because we need it, but because it speeds up the fetch a little bit.Having the query return a subset of the properties in a dictionary (rather than an entire managed object) and fetching the rest lazily is faster, but still not faster enough.I'm coming from Google App Engine here, so I'm used to the indexes they provide there. Essentially I want that sort of index, but applied to SQLite through Core Data. I found information on adding indexes in SQLite, the kind I would want, but doing this sort of indexing through Core Data, I can't find any information on that.",ios

48566,"dynamic modifier in functions in Swift According to Apple :When you mark a member declaration with the dynamic modifier, access to that member is always dynamically dispatched. Because declarations marked with the dynamic modifier are dispatched using the Objective-C runtime, they’re implicitly marked with the @objc attribute.According to Wikipedia:dynamic dispatch is the process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic operation (method or function) to call at run time.Dynamic dispatch is often used in object-oriented languages when different classes contain different implementations of the same method due to common inheritance. For example, suppose you have classes A, B, and C, where B and C both inherit the method foo() from A. Now suppose x is a variable of class A. At run time, x may actually have a value of type B or C and in general you can't know what it is at compile time.Right now, I'm studying the  dependency injection framework : Typhoon and when I open the sample project for Swift in all the classes that inherit from the Objective-C class TyphoonAssembly all the methods relatives to inject dependencies have the dynamic modifier included in the following way :public dynamic func weatherReportDao() -&gt; AnyObject {    return TyphoonDefinition.withClass(WeatherReportDaoFileSystemImpl.self)}I thought that I'm missing something, but I don't understand where is the polymorphic operation (method or function) to call at run time here.What's is the purpose of the dynamic dispatch here?",ios

38343,"Error in Swift class: Property not initialized at super.init call - How to initialize properties which need use of self in their initializer parameter I am overriding a UITableViewController in swift, in which I have two required variables which are initialized by using a weak reference of self since these are used to implement UITableViewDataSource protocol and need self reference to use its tableView propertyclass VideosListViewController: UITableViewController {    required init(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {    super.init(coder: aDecoder)    self.datasourceOfflineVideos = ASDataSource(tableViewController: self)    self.datasourceOnlineVideos = ASDataSource(tableViewController: self)  }    // MARK: - Variables  var datasourceOnlineVideos:ASDataSource  var datasourceOfflineVideos:ASDataSource  }Now the problem is as it is giving me error Property not initialized at super.init call which is expected as explained here: Error in Swift class: Property not initialized at super.init call.Swift’s compiler performs four helpful safety-checks to make sure that two-phase initialization is completed without errorSafety check 1 A designated initializer must ensure that all of the “properties introduced by its class are initialized before it delegates up to a superclass initializer.Excerpt From: Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11So my question is:If an instance variable in swift class needs self reference to be initialized like ASDataSource type  variables here, how can I do that??Since swift doesn't allow me call the super.init() before initiazing all the instance variables And also doesn't allow me to user self within the initializer in the init() before calling super.init()Currently I am using optional variable(s) to resolve the issue.

40247,"How Can a Stack Trace Point to the Wrong Line (the ""return"" Statement) - 40 Lines Off I have twice now seen a NullReferenceException logged from a Production ASP.NET MVC 4 web application - and logged on the wrong line. Not wrong by a line or two (like you would get with a PDB mismatch), but wrong by the length of the entire controller action. Example:public ActionResult Index(){    var someObject = GetObjectFromService();    if (someObject.SomeProperty == &quot;X&quot;) { // NullReferenceException here if someObject == null        // do something    }    // about 40 more lines of code    return View();    // Stack trace shows NullReferenceException here}This has happened twice for actions on the same controller. The second case was logged on// someObject is known non-null because of earlier dereferencesreturn someObject.OtherProperty    ? RedirecToAction(&quot;ViewName&quot;, &quot;ControllerName&quot;)    : RedirectToAction(&quot;OtherView&quot;, &quot;OtherController&quot;);This is very disturbing. NullReferenceException is very easy to fix once you know what line it occurs on. It's not quite so easy if the exception could have happened anywhere within the controller action!Has anyone ever seen anything like this at all, either in ASP.NET MVC or elsewhere? I'm willing to believe it's the difference between a Release build and a Debug build, but still, to be off by 40 lines?EDIT:To be clear: I'm the original author of &quot;What is a NullReferenceException and how do I fix it?&quot;.  I know what a NullReferenceException is. This question is about why could the stack trace be so far off. I have seen cases where a stack trace is off by a line or two due to PDB mismatch. I have seen cases where there is no PDB, so you don't get line numbers. But I have never seen a case where the stack trace is off by 32 lines.EDIT 2:Note that this has happened with two separate controller actions within the same controller. Their code is quite different from each other. In fact, in the first case, the NullReferenceException didn't even occur in a conditional - it was more like this:SomeMethod(someObject.SomeProperty);There was some chance that the code had been reorganized during optimization so that the actual NullReferenceException occurred closer to the return, and the PDB was in fact only off by a few lines. But I don't see an opportunity to rearrange a method call in a way that would cause the code to move by 32 lines. In fact, I just looked at the decompiled source, and it does not appear to have been rearranged.What these two cases have in common are:They occur in the same controller (so far)In both cases, the stack trace points to the return statement, and in both cases, the NullReferenceException occurred 30 or more lines away from the return statement.EDIT 3:I just did an experiment - I just rebuilt the solution using the &quot;Production&quot; build configuration that we have deployed to our Production servers. I ran the solution on my local IIS, without changing the IIS configuration at all.The stack trace showed the correct line number.EDIT 4:I don't know if this is relevant, but the circumstance causing the NullReferenceException is as unusual as this &quot;wrong line number&quot; issue itself. We appear to be losing session state for no good reason (no restarts or anything). That's not too strange. The strange part is that our Session_Start should be redirecting to the login page when that happens. Any attempt to reproduce the session loss causes the redirect to the login page. Subsequently using the browser &quot;Back&quot; button or manually entering the previous URL goes right back to the login page without hitting the controller in question.So maybe two weird problems is really one very weird problem.EDIT 5:I was able to obtain the .PDB file, and to look at it with dia2dump. I thought it was possible that the PDB was messed up, and only had line 72 for the method. That's not the case. All the line numbers are present in the PDB.EDIT 6:For the record, this just happened again, in a third controller. The stack trace points directly to the return statement of a method. This return statement is simply return model;. I don't think there's any way for that to cause a NullReferenceException.Edit 6a:In fact, I just looked more closely at the log and found several exceptions which are not NullReferenceException, and which still have the stack trace point at the return statement. Both of these cases are in methods called from the controller action, not directly in the action method itself. One of these was an explicitly thrown InvalidOperationException, and one was a simple FormatException.Here are a couple of facts I haven't thought relevant until now:The Application_Error in the global.asax is what causes these exceptions to be logged. It picks up the exceptions by using Server.GetLastError().The logging mechanism logs the message and stack trace separately (instead of logging ex.ToString(), which would have been my recommendation). In particular, the stack trace that I've been asking about comes from ex.StackTrace.The FormatException was raised in System.DateTime.Parse, called from System.Convert.ToDate, called from our code. The stack trace line that points to our code is the line that points to &quot;return model;&quot;.","c#,asp.net"

19388,"Right way to have ASP.NET / IIS NOT cache PDF files I have the following scenario, and I wanted suggestions on what is the best way to handle this. My web app (ASP.NET 2.0 / IIS 6) generates PDF files, and I have a results page with links to those PDFs. Now, I noticed that if I visit the results page, click on a PDF file (it opens in a new window), then re-generate the PDF file, and click on the same link in the results page, the OLD PDF is shown, instead of the new one. I had to delete the temporary internet files in order to see the new one.So, since I'm NOT serving an ASPX that actually writes the PDF (and I do not want the Save dialog to show), but straight linking to the PDF file, I want to know what the best way to make sure the user always sees the latest file in the server, not a cached version.I'm guessing adding no-cache headers is out of the question. But the PDF request would still go through an HTTP handler, so I'd like to know if I should create a specific HTTP handler to intercept requests for PDFs, or if i should do this at the IIS level...however I dont necessarily want to avoid caching ALL PDF's on that site. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance for the help.",asp.net
2483,"Normalization of Strings With String.ToUpperInvariant() I am currently storing normalized versions of strings in my SQL Server database in lower case.  For example, in my Users table, I have a UserName and a LoweredUserName field.  Depending on the context, I either use T-SQL's LOWER() function or C#'s String.ToLower() method to generate the lower case version of the user name to fill the LoweredUserName field.  According to Microsoft's guidelines and Visual Studio's code analysis rule CA1308, I should be using C#'s String.ToUpperInvariant() instead of ToLower().  According to Microsoft, this is both a performance and globalization issue: converting to upper case is safe, while converting to lower case can cause a loss of information (for example, the Turkish 'I' problem).If I move to using ToUpperInvariant for string normalization, I will have to change my database schema as well, since my schema is based on Microsoft's ASP.NET Membership framework (see this related question), which normalizes strings to lower case.Isn't Microsoft contradicting itself by telling us to use upper case normalization in C#, while it's own code in the Membership tables and procedures is using lower case normalization?  Should I switch everything to upper case normalization, or just continue using lower case normalization?","c#,asp.net"

47224,"Manage a UIPickerView from an External Class - Using Swift I cannot seem to find the connection to have an external class manage a view in a ViewController. I'm new to iOS and have spent considerable looking for a solution.  Simple Example:Subclass of UIPickerViewI create a file that is a subclass of UIPickerView and have it conform to the PickerView delegate and datasource. class MyPickerView: UIPickerView, UIPickerViewDelegate, UIPickerViewDataSource {    //In here I conform to all the required methods...no problems there}Main View Controller with Outlet for the PickerViewIn my MainViewController, I create an outlet for my picker view. Also, in the StoryBoard I hookup the ""custom class"" for my Picker View to MyPickerView above. class MainViewController: UIViewController {    @IBOutlet weak var myPickerView: UIPickerView!    override func viewDidLoad() {        //how do I hookup my picker view class    }}My Questions:How do I tell my MainViewController that my subclass ""MyPickerView"" is managing the picker view for it?How did I enable communication between the subclass and the view controller?---------------------UPDATE: FINAL SOLUTION Incorporating @Oscar's Answer@Oscar's suggestion below was great. To clarify, I wanted my PickerView subclass to be the UIPickerView Delegate because the Picker will always have the same UI and there are many PickerView delegate methods for UI. (attributedTitleForRow, widthForComponent, rowHeightForComponent, etc) I don't want to call those delegate methods in every ViewController that uses this PickerView. Now, when the PickerView ""didSelectRow"" is called, we need to notify our ViewController and pass the value that was selected. To get this to work, I used a Protocol. (summarized below) This topic took me a while to learn, but is crucial, so I suggest spending time with Protocols &amp; Delegation if this doesn't make sense.Create a protocol in the PickerView with a func that will be used to talk to ViewControllers that present this PickerView:protocol MyPickerViewProtocol {    func myPickerDidSelectRow(selectedRowValue:Int?)}In the ViewController presenting the PickerView, conform to your PickerView protocol. By doing so, you will have to place the func myPickerDidSelectRow somewhere in your ViewController:class MyViewController: MyPickerViewProtocol {    func myPickerDidSelectRow(selectedRowValue:Int?) {         //do stuff to update your ViewController     }}@Oscar's answer below will hookup the picker view to your view controller, but there's one last thing.  In order for the PickerView to talk back, you will want a property in your PickerView, that is a reference to the view controller it's contained in. Here's the PickeView and ViewController classes in perspective: //PickerView Subclass ------------------protocol MyPickerViewProtocol {    func myPickerDidSelectRow(selectedRowValue:Int?)}class MyPickerView: UIPickerView {    //Note: this var is of type your Picker protocol above. Because the ViewController will conform to the protocol, this var will be the reference (or the pointer) to the protocol func you implement in your ViewController...which is myPickerDidSelectRow    var propertyThatReferencesThisViewController:MyPickerViewProtocol?}        //ViewController Class ----------------myPicker = MyPickerView()myPickerView.dataSource = myPicker //note: myPickerView is the outlet of type UIPickerView in your ViewControllermyPickerView.delegate = myPicker//HERE'S THE PROPERTY from our PickerView subclass that will point to this ViewController's protocol methods that we implemented. From the MyPickerViewProtocolmyPicker.propertyThatReferencesThisViewController = selfNow when a row is selected in our PickerView, let's tell the ViewController using our property: propertyThatReferencesThisViewControllerclass MyPickerView: UIPickerView {    //This Property points to the ViewController conforming to the protocol. This property will only be able to access the stuff you put in the protocol. It won't access everything in your ViewController    var propertyThatReferencesThisViewController:MyPickerViewProtocol?    //didSelectRow UIPickerView Delegate method that apple gives us    func pickerView(pickerView: UIPickerView, didSelectRow row: Int, inComponent component: Int) {        //get your picker values that you need        let theRowValue = someArray[row]        propertyThatReferencesThisViewController?.myPickerDidSelectRow(theRowValue)        //the ViewController func will be called passing the row value along    }}",ios

Below is a JSFiddle where I have done a rotate+translate on many instances of the same SVG pulled from the DOM, each to a different amount rotation according to the datapoint.A key thing to note is that I need this solution to work when translating from (100,100) to (500,500) just as well as when I start from (0,0).https://jsfiddle.net/3jbv23em/var serializer = new XMLSerializer();var svgNode = serializer.serializeToString(document.querySelector('#svgs svg defs svg'));var dataset = [1,8,15,22,29,36,43,50,57,64,71,78,85,92,99,106,113,120,127,134,141,148,155,162,169,176,183,190,197,204,211,218,225,232,239,246,253,260,267,274,281,288,295,302,309,316,323,330,337,344,351,358]var wrapper = d3    .select('#game svg')        .attr('width', window.innerWidth)        .attr('height', window.innerHeight)    .selectAll('g')        .data(dataset)        .enter()        .append('g')            .html(function(d) { return svgNode; })            .transition()            .duration(1500)            .attr('transform', function(d) {                 return 'translate(500,300)' +                       'rotate(' + d * 1.8 + ', 63, 54.77)';            });(Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get D3 v4 working in JSFiddle, so JSFiddle is using v3 here. However, the problem is the same).My expected behaviour: All of the chickens rotate around the same center, never extending past the dimensions of the circle seen at the end of the animation.The actual result: All chickens rotate around the translated original position of the top left corner before returning to the correct position at the end.Solutions That Didn't Work for Me:How to rotate an object around the center in d3.jsThis is about rotating around a fixed point further away, not around a point on the object one is trying to rotateSVG rotation anchorpointThis might work, but completely takes me out of the D3 ecosystemHow do I rotate or scale (transform) an SVG path relative to its center point?I need the solution to start from an arbitrary point, not always the origin @ (0,0)In Conclusion:I'm pretty bewildered at the moment, and any help is greatly appreciated.

The development works perfectly fine; however, one question remains unanswered: What is the recommended approach to generate the three files PhoneGap needs (one HTML page, one JavaScript file, and one CSS stylesheet) from our MVC solution?Would you recommend using a Razor template-based approach? Or would you simply automatically copy the output HTML source after each build? Or would you suggest something completely else?",asp.net

I'm almost done building my first iPhone app and am trying to add a background image, and am finding it a little confusing, because nowadays there's like 3 or 4 different size screens among the different iPhone versions, with different resolutions to boot.So while I'm aware of the whole image@2x.png thing, I still don't know what I really need. If I want my app to run on iPhone 4/4s, 5s/5c, 6/6+, how many different versions of a background image do I need, and at what sizes and resolutions?I have googled around and have not found any cohesive answers up to date for 2014.Also, if the iPhone 6 is 1334x750 @3x, does that mean I'm supposed to include a 4002x2250 background?

5856,"Updating ShaderMaterial attribute in three.js From the three.js tutorial on shaders, we learn we can update uniform values of a ShaderMaterial:var attributes = {  displacement: {    type: 'f', // a float    value: [] // an empty array  }};var uniforms = {  amplitude: {    type: 'f', // a float    value: 1  }};var vShader = $('#vertexshader');var fShader = $('#fragmentshader');// create the final materialvar shaderMaterial =    new THREE.MeshShaderMaterial({      uniforms:       uniforms,      attributes:     attributes,      vertexShader:   vShader.text(),      fragmentShader: fShader.text()    });...var frame = 0;function update() {  // update the amplitude based on  // the frame value.  uniforms.amplitude.value =    Math.cos(frame);  // update the frame counter  frame += 0.1;  renderer.render(scene, camera);  // set up the next call  requestAnimFrame(update);}What isn't mentioned is whether this same behavior extends to attributes. From my own experimenting, I tried making vertices from the sphere demo jitter about by assigning random displacements every frame, e.g.:   function update() {    // update the amplitude based on    // the frame value.    values = attributes.displacement.value    for(var v = 0; v &lt; vertCount; v++) {        values[v] = (Math.random() * 30);    }    renderer.render(scene, camera);    // set up the next call    requestAnimFrame(update);  }However the result is a static misshapen ball. It appears that attributes only take on the first value to which they are assigned. After that, they cannot be updated. However, is this a behavior expected of glsl attributes or is there an additional step I need to take to update attributes? If the latter, is there a workaround available to achieve the desired besides setting vertex positions in javascript?",javascript

21335,"Flex 4.6 hide/dismiss softkeyboard I'm having some issues with the softkeyboard behaviour in flex 4.6 and air 3.1I have a list with a search bar on top. When a user selects the TextInput component the softkeyboard pops up like it should.Now when the user is done typing his text and presses the return (or the done/search/...) key I want the softkeyboard to disappear.What I've tried so far:I've set the returnKeyLabel property to ""done"" and the button showsup accordingly. However it only dismisses the keyboard on Android, onIOS the keyboard just stays up.I then tried by not setting the returnKeyLabel and manuallycatching the Return key and setting the focus to another element thatdoes not require a softkeyboard but that didn't work either.I also tried by dispatching my own ""faked"" click events when the Return key was pressed but this also didn't work.As part of searching about this problem I found this Dismiss SoftKeyboard in Flex Mobile but that didn't work either.

For the longest time I thought asynchronous was synonymous to running something on a background thread, while synchronous meant on the main thread (blocking UI updates and interactions).

In my memory usage, the growth is increasing pretty rapidly.However, when I add the following code after pushing the VC:[vc release];my MKMapView class calls the dealloc method.Of course this would be a simple solution if the MKMapView class was the only class returned by my app delegate (or I could just check if the VC's class is my MKMapView class). However, I would like to solve the root problem of this.Why is the dealloc not being called if I set autorelease on my view controller?How is it possible that I can add [vc release] to the view controller even though autorelease is used on that vc?ThanksEdit:Here's some additional info. I have the viewControllerForItem class in my app delegate. I'm returning the auto released object into my other manager class where I then push the view controller. Is the retain count being messed up when I return an autoreleased object, and then push it in some other class?This is the backtrace / callstack right when I push the VC and when the mkmapview's didDissappear is called:pushVC: (0   NewHampshire                        0x00254cdf -[CustomViewController navigateToRowId:withLinkBehavior:animated:] + 21111   NewHampshire                        0x002534c9 -[CustomViewController webView:shouldStartLoadWithRequest:navigationType:] + 8412   UIKit                               0x02caf288 -[UIWebView webView:decidePolicyForNavigationAction:request:frame:decisionListener:] + 3183   UIKit                               0x02cb1854 -[UIWebViewWebViewDelegate webView:decidePolicyForNavigationAction:request:frame:decisionListener:] + 774   CoreFoundation                      0x05d0bd1d __invoking___ + 295   CoreFoundation                      0x05d0bc2a -[NSInvocation invoke] + 3626   CoreFoundation                      0x05d0bdaa -[NSInvocation invokeWithTarget:] +     747   WebKit                              0x0a4d811d -[_WebSafeForwarder forwardInvocation:] + 1578   CoreFoundation                      0x05d076da ___forwarding___ + 4589   CoreFoundation                      0x05d074ee _CF_forwarding_prep_0 + 1410  CoreFoundation                      0x05d0bd1d __invoking___ + 2911  CoreFoundation                      0x05d0bc2a -[NSInvocation invoke] + 36212  WebCore                             0x09533b29 _ZL20HandleDelegateSourcePv + 12113  CoreFoundation                      0x05ca083f __CFRUNLOOP_IS_CALLING_OUT_TO_A_SOURCE0_PERFORM_FUNCTION__ + 1514  CoreFoundation                      0x05ca01cb __CFRunLoopDoSources0 + 23515  CoreFoundation                      0x05cbd29e __CFRunLoopRun + 91016  CoreFoundation                      0x05cbcac3 CFRunLoopRunSpecific + 46717  CoreFoundation                      0x05cbc8db CFRunLoopRunInMode + 12318  GraphicsServices                    0x059749e2 GSEventRunModal + 19219  GraphicsServices                    0x05974809 GSEventRun + 10420  UIKit                               0x02a6ed3b UIApplicationMain + 122521  NewHampshire                        0x000150dd main + 12522  libdyld.dylib                       0x04fab70d start + 1)disappear: (0   NewHampshire                        0x0014631d -[CustomAdvancedGPSMapViewController viewDidDisappear:] + 1731   UIKit                               0x02b85bac -[UIViewController _setViewAppearState:isAnimating:] + 3412   UIKit                               0x02b86328 -[UIViewController __viewDidDisappear:] + 1503   UIKit                               0x02b86461 -[UIViewController _endAppearanceTransition:] + 3064   UIKit                               0x02ba549a -[UINavigationController navigationTransitionView:didEndTransition:fromView:toView:] + 7385   UIKit                               0x02b9d403 __49-[UINavigationController _startCustomTransition:]_block_invoke + 2066   UIKit                               0x03176740 -[_UIViewControllerTransitionContext completeTransition:] + 997   UIKit                               0x02a63454 __53-[_UINavigationParallaxTransition animateTransition:]_block_invoke105 + 6808   UIKit                               0x02ad1005 -[UIViewAnimationBlockDelegate _didEndBlockAnimation:finished:context:] + 3069   UIKit                               0x02abac6c -[UIViewAnimationState sendDelegateAnimationDidStop:finished:] + 26710  UIKit                               0x02abaf58 -[UIViewAnimationState animationDidStop:finished:] + 8011  QuartzCore                          0x028b2a44 _ZN2CA5Layer23run_animation_callbacksEPv + 30412  libdispatch.dylib                   0x04d194b0 _dispatch_client_callout + 1413  libdispatch.dylib                   0x04d0775e _dispatch_main_queue_callback_4CF + 34014  CoreFoundation                      0x05d7ca5e __CFRUNLOOP_IS_SERVICING_THE_MAIN_DISPATCH_QUEUE__ + 1415  CoreFoundation                      0x05cbd6bb __CFRunLoopRun + 196316  CoreFoundation                      0x05cbcac3 CFRunLoopRunSpecific + 46717  CoreFoundation                      0x05cbc8db CFRunLoopRunInMode + 12318  GraphicsServices                    0x059749e2 GSEventRunModal + 19219  GraphicsServices                    0x05974809 GSEventRun + 10420  UIKit                               0x02a6ed3b UIApplicationMain + 122521  NewHampshire                        0x0001507d main + 12522  libdyld.dylib                       0x04fab70d start + 1)Solution: Although the responses in this post didn't provide the exact solution to my problem, Darren definitely steered me into the correct direction using the instruments tool.

20166,"IE 8 and client-side caching Background story:I have a web portal in .NET 3.5 on an IIS 6 web server.  Currently there is a page that is given a value and based on that value looks up a PDF file on a web service and displays the results to the user in another tab in the web page.  This is done with the following code. context.Response.ClearContent(); context.Response.ClearHeaders(); context.Response.Clear(); context.Response.AddHeader(""Accept-Header"", pdfStream.Length.ToString());                                                context.Response.ContentType = ""application/pdf""; context.Response.BinaryWrite(pdfStream.ToArray()); context.Response.Flush();This works and has worked for years.  However we got an issue from the client that a particular client was having the PDF returned as the same PDF every time until they cleared temp internet cache.I thought oh cool, this is an easy one.  I will just add the cache headers to the response to never cache it.  So I added the following:context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);//IE set to not cachecontext.Response.Cache.SetNoStore();//Firefox/Chrome not to cachecontext.Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.UtcNow); //for safe measure expire it immediately After a quick test I got exactly what I was expecting in the response header.Cache-Control    no-cache, no-store Pragma    no-cache Expires    -1 The Problem:So this went live.  Everything seemed cool day one.  The day after, bam, everyone started getting white screens and no PDF displayed.  After further investigation, I found out it was only IE 6,7,8.  Chrome is fine, Firefox fine, safari fine, even IE 9 fine.  Without knowing the why this happened, I reverted my change and deployed it, and everything started worked again.I have searched all over trying to find out why my caching headers seemed to confuse IE 6-8 to no avail.

9101,"`touchesBegan:withEvent:` is delayed at left edge of screen I'm experiencing an issue where the first call to touchesBegan:withEvent: on a UIView or UIViewController is delayed when you touch on the left edge of the screen. This seems to be a new issue with iOS 10, and only happens on devices with 3D Touch (iPhone 6s and newer). In fact, if you disable 3D Touch in General->Accessibility, the issue goes away.However, the issue doesn't seem to happen when you use UIGestureRecognizers. My workaround at the moment is to create a UIGestureRecognizer subclass that overrides the touches* methods and forwards them to my old implementation.Is this just a bug or is there a way to get rid of the delay?",ios
18351,"iOS Refresh button in View Controller Nav: reloading all tableViewCells created from parsed JSON when clicked I've got a fairly important conceptual issue that many people have asked about, but there isn't a readily available clear answer to be found by searching.My application is simple: Several rows of TableViewCells populated with data from a parsed JSON feed. When a cell is clicked on, that cell's info is passed to a SecondViewController and displayed. The JSON feed is also stored to a .plist and in the case that the internet is not available, the TableViewCells are populated from the .plist.This is all working great.However, the last thing I need is a refresh button at the top of my FirstViewController to refresh the JSON feed, and all of the cells in the table with the new data from the new variables. However, I've encountered an issue with implementing this:My original JSON call, and variables to populate the cells are located in the ViewDidLoad method. When the view loads, these variables are ""set"" and don't refresh. Further, I can move the JSON call and variables into viewWillLoad - which will refresh the table each time after clicking on a cell, and then clicking ""back"" to the firstViewController -- this will update the JSON and cells successfully, however it does impact the speed and makes the view controller ""pause"" when going back to the MainViewController, which makes calling my original JSON and setting my variables in viewWillLoad an unviable option.I have created a reload button in ViewDidLoad, which is linked to an IBAction method ""refresh"":Create Button Programitically in ViewDidLoad:// Reload issues buttonUIBarButtonItem *button = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc]                           initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemRefresh                           target:self                           action:@selector(refresh:)];self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = button;[button release];Action Method it's linked to:- (IBAction)refresh:(id)sender {    myRawJson = [[NSString alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:[NSURL                                    URLWithString:@""http://www.yoursite.com/json.JSON""]                                    encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding                                   error:nil];    SBJsonParser *parser = [[SBJsonParser alloc] init];    NSDictionary * myParsedJson = [parser objectWithString:myRawJson error:NULL];// New updated dictionary built from refreshed JSON    allLetterContents = [myParsedJson objectForKey:@""nodes""];// Log the new refreshed JSON    NSLog(@""You clicked refresh. Your new JSON is %@"", myRawJson);    //Maybe use the notification center?? But don't know how to implement.    //[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self                                             selector:@selector(refreshView:)                                             name:@""refreshView"" object:nil];    //[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:@""refreshView""                                             object:nil];    }    [self.tableView reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:[self.tableView indexPathsForVisibleRows]                      withRowAnimation:UITableViewRowAnimationNone];    [myRawJson release];}In the code above you can see that I'm re-calling the JSON each time the button is clicked and logging a message to console with the new JSON. This is working. I've even re-built a dictionary which is successfully adding the new content.My question is: How can I make the tableViewCells ""refresh"" with this new data as well? Can I just make the button re-load the entire view controller - so it would call ViewDidLoad again? Do I need to re-think my apps structure, or move my original variables out of viewDidLoad?I've been reading some posts on the NSNotificationCenter, but the implementation of this still baffles me, as I'm fairly new to iOS development.Thanks~Update:It's still not updating.

I have not been able to find any sample code either.I tried testing the following, but there is no network traffic recorded:let session = URLSession(configuration: .default, delegate: self, delegateQueue: nil)let stream = session.streamTask(withHostName: ""https://stream.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/sample.json"", port: 22)stream.startSecureConnection()stream.readData(ofMinLength: 0, maxLength: 100000, timeout: 60, completionHandler: { (data, bool, error) in   print(""bool = \(bool)"")   print(""error = \(String(describing: error))"")})stream.resume()I've also implemented the delegate methods (including URLSessionStreamDelegate), but they do not get called. It would be really helpful if someone code post a sample of how to open a persistent connection for chunked responses from a streaming endpoint. Also, I am seeking solutions which don't involve third party libraries. A response similar to https://stackoverflow.com/a/9473787/5897233 but updated with the URLSession equivalent would be ideal.Note: Authorization info was omitted from the sample code above.",ios

19050,"Why does this javascript based printing cause Safari to refresh the page? The page I am working on has a javascript function executed to print parts of the page.For some reason, printing in Safari, causes the window to somehow update. I say somehow, because it does not really refresh as in reload the page, but rather it starts the ""rendering"" of the page from start, i.e. scroll to top, flash animations start from 0, and so forth.The effect is reproduced by this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/fYmnB/Clicking the print button and finishing or cancelling a print in Safari causes the screen to ""go white"" for a sec, which in my real website manifests itself as something ""like"" a reload. While running print button with, let's say, Firefox, just opens and closes the print dialogue without affecting the fiddle page in any way.Is there something with my way of calling the browsers print method that causes this, or how can it be explained - and preferably, avoided?P.S.: On my real site the same occurs with Chrome. In the example fiddle Chrome seems to not show the same behaviour as Safari, though.Edit: I also tried to have the printing button on a different tag than an a anchor, like span or button, but that didn't help with the problem.Edit: I run into this problem with Safari 5.1.2 on Mac OS 10.6.8. In the jsfiddle example, the behavior shows as a white ""flicker"" that covers the whole browser after having clicked the print button and closing (either printing or aborting) the print dialogue.Edit: Just started a bounty for this question, as I am still looking for an explanation for this browser behaviour. I am more than willing to give more details on the issue. From my experience on SO it is not adviseable to post links to online pages, however I feel the problem is really hard to reproduce.

13773,"Single Page Application Project Templates for.NET 4.5 and Angular Has there ever been a more confusing/difficult time to be a web developer using the Microsoft stack? That's not really my question... I know that the answer is a categorical no. :)The single page app template that comes with VS 2013 is deplorable.I've been working on building up a similar project template that uses Angular JS on the client, but I'm starting to spin my wheels a bit porting over the external (openId/oauth) login features. I believe this is because of the lack of good, single-point-of-truth, and current documentation for Katana's auth/security bits and also because of how unreadable the client side code is in the S.P.A. template in visual studio 2013.I know that I can get through it, but while I'm struggling with it, I'm wondering:Are there any good community provided project templates or example code bases in existence that use .NET 4.5 (MVC5/Web Api 2), Angular JS, the new ASP.NET Identity stuff, and the Katana packages?There's HotTowel.Angular, but it takes no stance on security. Besides, it's a Nuget package, which can't or shouldn't dictate as much as a proper project template can.",asp.net

5928,"How do you create multiple forms on the same page with redux-forms v6? I have a simple todo app in which my redux store contains an array of 'todos'. My 'Todo' component maps over every 'todo' in the store and renders a 'TodoForm' component that uses redux-forms v6.As it is now, every 'todo' shares the same form name/key, so every time I input something in the 'title' Field, it changes the 'title' of every todo. I found a work around by using unique Field names, but I fear it's going to over complicate things as the app grows, and would prefer to use unique Form names so every field can have the same name without interfering with the other forms (TodoForm1, TodoForm2, TodoForm3 can all have a unique 'title' Field instead of TodoForm containing 'title1', 'title2', 'title3' Fields).I tried accessing the TodoForm's props so I could set each form's key as the component's unique id, but it doesn't seem like the component receives props that early. I also tried making an immediately invoked function where it spits out a random number, and using that number as the form's name, but that also didn't work.How can I can map through all my todos and render a v6 redux-form with a unique form key?Here's a picture of the app, console, and redux devtools. There's 3 'todos', but there's only one form that connects them all, todo-926, even though each form key should have been randomly generated in an immediately invoked function:HomePageMainSection.index.jsrenderTodos(todo) {    if (!todo) {      return &lt;div&gt;No Todos&lt;/div&gt;;    }    return (      &lt;div key={todo.get('id')}&gt;        &lt;Todo          todo={todo}          updateTodo={this.props.updateTodo}          deleteTodo={this.props.deleteTodo}        /&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;    );  }  render() {    if (!this.props.todos) {      return &lt;div&gt;No Todos&lt;/div&gt;;    }    return (      &lt;div className={styles.homePageMainSection}&gt;        &lt;h1&gt;Hey I'm the Main Section&lt;/h1&gt;        &lt;div&gt;          {this.props.todos.get('todos').map(this.renderTodos)}        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;    );  }Todo.index.js:  renderTodo() {    if (this.state.editMode) {      return (        &lt;TodoForm          todo={this.props.todo} changeTodoEditMode={this.changeTodoEditMode}          updateTodo={this.props.updateTodo}        /&gt;      );    }    return (      &lt;div className={styles.Todo} onClick={this.changeTodoEditMode}&gt;        &lt;div className=""card card-block""&gt;          &lt;h4 className=""card-title""&gt;{this.props.todo.get('author')}&lt;/h4&gt;          &lt;p className=""card-text""&gt;{this.props.todo.get('title')}&lt;/p&gt;          &lt;i            className={`${styles.deleteIcon} btn btn-danger fa fa-times`}            onClick={this.deleteTodo}          &gt;&lt;/i&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;    );  }  render() {    return (      &lt;div className=""col-xs-6 col-sm-4""&gt;        {this.renderTodo()}      &lt;/div&gt;    );  }TodoForm.index.js:class TodoForm extends React.Component { // eslint-disable-line react/prefer-stateless-function  constructor(props) {    super(props);    this._handleSubmit = this._handleSubmit.bind(this);  }  _handleSubmit(formData) {    console.log('');    console.log('OG: ', this.props.todo)    console.log('formData: ', formData);    const data = this.props.todo.update('title', formData.get('title'));    console.log('data: ', data);    console.log('');    // this.props.updateTodo(data);  }  render() {    const { handleSubmit, pristine, submitting } = this.props;    return (      &lt;form className={`${styles.todoForm} card`} onSubmit={handleSubmit(this._handleSubmit)}&gt;        &lt;div className=""card-block""&gt;          &lt;label htmlFor=""title""&gt;{this.props.todo.get('title')}&lt;/label&gt;          &lt;div className={'form-group'}&gt;            &lt;Field name={`title`} component=""input"" type=""text"" placeholder=""Enter new title"" className=""form-control"" /&gt;          &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div className=""card-block btn-group"" role=""group""&gt;          &lt;button            className=""btn btn-success""            type=""submit""            disabled={pristine || submitting}          &gt;            Submit          &lt;/button&gt;          &lt;button            className=""btn btn-danger fa fa-times""            onClick={this.props.changeTodoEditMode}          &gt;          &lt;/button&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/form&gt;    );  }}const randomNum = (() =&gt; {  const thing = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1;  console.log('thing: ', thing);  console.log('notThing: ', TodoForm.props);  return thing;})();export default reduxForm({  form: `todo-${randomNum}`,})(TodoForm);",javascript

Hi all.We all know that you can access a property of a javascript object by it's name using the [] syntax.. e.g. ob['nameOfProperty'].Can you do the same for a local variable?  Another answer here suggested the answer is to use window['nameOfVar'].  However, this only worked for the poster as he was defining variables at window-level scope.I assume that this must be possible in general, as Firefox's Firebug (which I believe is written in javascript) can show local and closure variables. Is there some hidden language feature I'm not aware of? Specifically, here's what I want to do: var i = 4; console.log(window['i']); // this works.. function Func(){     var j = 99;     // try to output the value of j from its name as a string     console.log(window['j']); // unsurprisingly, this doesn't work } Func();",javascript

13612,"What is the best way to filter spam with JavaScript? I have recently been inspired to write spam filters in JavaScript, Greasemonkey-style, for several websites I use that are prone to spam (especially in comments). When considering my options about how to go about this, I realize I have several options, each with pros/cons. My goal for this question is to expand on this list I have created, and hopefully determine the best way of client-side spam filtering with JavaScript. As for what makes a spam filter the ""best"", I would say these are the criteria:Most accurateLeast vulnerable to attacksFastestMost transparentAlso, please note that I am trying to filter content that already exists on websites that aren't mine, using Greasemonkey Userscripts. In other words, I can't prevent spam; I can only filter it.Here is my attempt, so far, to compile a list of the various methods along with their shortcomings and benefits:Rule-based filters: What it does: ""Grades"" a message by assigning a point value to different criteria (i.e. all uppercase, all non-alphanumeric, etc.) Depending on the score, the message is discarded or kept.Benefits: Easy to implementMostly transparentShortcomings: Transparent- it's usually easy to reverse engineer the code to discover the rules, and thereby craft messages which won't be picked upHard to balance point values (false positives)Can be slow; multiple rules have to be executed on each message, a lot of times using regular expressionsIn a client-side environment, server interaction or user interaction is required to update the rulesBayesian filtering:What it does: Analyzes word frequency (or trigram frequency) and compares it against the data it has been trained with.Benefits: No need to craft rulesFast (relatively)Tougher to reverse engineerShortcomings:Requires training to be effectiveTrained data must still be accessible to JavaScript; usually in the form of human-readable JSON, XML, or flat fileData set can get pretty largePoorly designed filters are easy to confuse with a good helping of common words to lower the spamacity ratingWords that haven't been seen before can't be accurately classified; sometimes resulting in incorrect classification of entire messageIn a client-side environment, server interaction or user interaction is required to update the rulesBayesian filtering- server-side: What it does: Applies Bayesian filtering server side by submitting each message to a remote server for analysis.Benefits:All the benefits of regular Bayesian filteringTraining data is not revealed to users/reverse engineersShortcomings:Heavy trafficStill vulnerable to uncommon wordsStill vulnerable to adding common words to decrease spamacityThe service itself may be abusedTo train the classifier, it may be desirable to allow users to submit spam samples for training. Attackers may abuse this serviceBlacklisting:What it does: Applies a set of criteria to a message or some attribute of it. If one or more (or a specific number of) criteria match, the message is rejected. A lot like rule-based filtering, so see its description for details.CAPTCHAs, and the like:Not feasible for this type of application. I am trying to apply these methods to sites that already exist. Greasemonkey will be used to do this; I can't start requiring CAPTCHAs in places that they weren't before someone installed my script.Can anyone help me fill in the blanks? Thank you,",javascript

If I use a datasource to pull this out it will write [1 Home] in the text rather than put the int as the value and Home as the text to display.I guess I have a multiple part question really.One:Am I being stupid?

41459,"Svelte/Sapper.js - How to initialize store with localStorage data? I come from a React background, but I'm switching to Svelte and Sapper for my next application in order to fight the massive bundle size that comes with React these days. However, I'm having trouble initializing Svelte's store with data retrieved from localStorage.As per the Sapper docs (https://sapper.svelte.dev/docs#Getting_started), I created my project by running npx degit &quot;sveltejs/sapper-template#rollup&quot; my-app from the command line. I then installed the dependencies and removed the demo code in the src folder.I then created two files: src/routes/index.svelte and src/store/index.js.Code for both:src/store/index.js    import {writable} from &quot;svelte/store&quot;;        export let userLang;        if(typeof window !== &quot;undefined&quot;) {        userLang = writable(localStorage.getItem(&quot;lang&quot;) || &quot;en&quot;);    } else {        userLang = writable(null);    }src/routes/index.svelte    &lt;script&gt;        import {userLang} from &quot;../store&quot;;    &lt;/script&gt;        &lt;p&gt;Your Preferred Language: {$userLang}&lt;/p&gt;When I run the application and hit the index route, I see this:Your Preferred Language: nullwhich then almost immediately updates and changes toYour Preferred Language: enwhen there is no lang item in localStorage, and changes toYour Preferred Language: frAfter explicitly setting localStorage.setItem(&quot;lang&quot;, &quot;fr&quot;) from the developer console and refreshing.I know that the store is being initialized on the server first where window is undefined and then is being rehydrated on the client. So this behavior is expected.So my question is: how can I skip the server initialization entirely? Is it possible to only set up the store on the client (where localStorage is defined) so that the user's chosen language is immediately available?I can't default to having everything in English or any other language after the user has chosen to change their preferred language. I also can't get the user language from the browser via navigator.language on initial page load either since navigator is undefined on the server as well.And having a flash of empty text appear before the store rehydrates would screw up the UX for my application, especially when the value of userLang is going to be used all over the place with translations.So any strategies or hacks for this are definitely appreciated.**** Deeper Issue ****I would actually prefer to not have server-side rendering at all for this application, but I do need all the other excellent features that Sapper provides, like routing, prefetching, and static site building.So I tried running npx sapper export as per the docs to generate a completely static site in an effort to remove the server from the equation, but the exact same issue still occurs, even though there is no server being used at all.Does anyone have any advice on how to configure Sapper and turn off SSR but keep the other features?Thank you!**** Update ****As per Rich Harris's answer, wrapping the markup with {#if process.browser} does the trick just fine. So I've updated the src/routes/index.sveltefile like so:    &lt;script&gt;        import {userLang} from &quot;../store&quot;;    &lt;/script&gt;    {#if process.browser}        &lt;p&gt;Your Preferred Language: {$userLang}&lt;/p&gt;    {/if}And the userLang variable is immediately set with the value from localStorage or defaults to en as I intended for this simple demo. There is no more flash of null, so it's essentially behaving like it's client-side only at this point.I will work on fleshing out my project and see if there are any more issues I encounter. Til then, I think this solves my issue.",javascript

46637,"Variable width & height of UICollectionViewCell using AutoLayout with Storyboard (without XIB) Here is an design issue in the app that uses AutoLayout, UICollectionView and UICollectionViewCell that has automatically resizable width &amp; height depending on AutoLayout constraints and its content (some text).It is a UITableView list like, with each cell that has it's own width &amp; height calculated separately for each row dependant on its content. It is more like iOS Messages build in app (or WhatsUp).It is obvious that app should make use of func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, layout collectionViewLayout: UICollectionViewLayout, sizeForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; CGSize.Issue is that within that method, app cannot call func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; UICollectionViewCell nor dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier(identifier: String, forIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath!) -&gt; AnyObject to instantiate cell, populate it with specific content and calculate its width &amp; height. Trying to do that will result in an indefinite recursion calls or some other type of app crash (at least in iOS 8.3).The closest way to fix this situation seems to copy definition of the cell into view hierarchy to let Auto-layout resize ""cell"" automatically (like cell to have the same width as parent collection view), so app can configure cell with specific content and calculate its size. This should definitely not be the only way to fix it because of duplicated resources.All of that is connected with setting UILabel.preferredMaxLayoutWidth to some value that should be Auto-Layout controllable (not hardcoded) that could depend on screen width &amp; height or at least setup by Auto-layout constraint definition, so app can get multiline UILabel intrinsic size  calculated.I would not like to instantiate cells from XIB file since Storyboards should be today's industry standard and I would like to have as less intervention in code.EDIT:The basic code that cannot be run is listed bellow. So only instantiating variable cellProbe (not used) crashes the app. Without that call, app runs smoothly.var onceToken: dispatch_once_t = 0class ViewController: UICollectionViewController, UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout {    override func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {        return 1    }    func collectionView(collectionView: UICollectionView, layout collectionViewLayout: UICollectionViewLayout, sizeForItemAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -&gt; CGSize {        dispatch_once(&amp;onceToken) {            let cellProbe = collectionView.dequeueReusableCellWithReuseIdentifier(""first"", forIndexPath: NSIndexPath(forRow: 0, inSection: 0)) as!

2802,"UIRefreshControl with UICollectionView in iOS7 In my application I use refresh control with collection view.UICollectionView *collectionView = [[UICollectionView alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds];collectionView.alwaysBounceVertical = YES;...[self.view addSubview:collectionView];UIRefreshControl *refreshControl = [UIRefreshControl new];[collectionView addSubview:refreshControl];iOS7 has some nasty bug that when you pull collection view down and don't release your finger when refreshing begins, vertical contentOffset shifts for 20-30 points down which results in ugly scroll jump.Tables have this problem too if you use them with refresh control outside of UITableViewController. But for them it could be easily solved by assigning your UIRefreshControl instance to UITableView's private property called _refreshControl:@interface UITableView ()- (void)_setRefreshControl:(UIRefreshControl *)refreshControl;@end...UITableView *tableView = [[UITableView alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds];[self.view addSubview:tableView];UIRefreshControl *refreshControl = [UIRefreshControl new];[tableView addSubview:refreshControl];[tableView _setRefreshControl:refreshControl];But UICollectionView does not have such property so there must be some way to deal with it manually.",ios

36535,"Using 'window', 'document' and 'undefined' as arguments in anonymous function that wraps a jQuery plugin Honestly, I didn't know how to make the title shorter.I learnt how to write a jQuery plugin by studying the source of SlidesJS plugin. When I encountered something new, I just asked my good friend Google and most of the times, got a satisfactory answer. Honestly though, I never made much effort. All I know is that $ is (probably) a shorthand jQuery object constructor and that $() and jQuery() are the same thing provided jQuery is included.Recently, though, I tried to understand the science behind jQuery and how to write a good jQuery plugin. I came across a very good article in which the author listed several templates for creating a jQuery plugin. Since the rest were too complex for me to understand, I liked the first one: A Lightweight Start. Now, here is the code for the said template./*! * jQuery lightweight plugin boilerplate * Original author: @ajpiano * Further changes, comments: @addyosmani * Licensed under the MIT license */// the semi-colon before the function invocation is a safety // net against concatenated scripts and/or other plugins // that are not closed properly.;(function ( $, window, document, undefined ) {    // undefined is used here as the undefined global     // variable in ECMAScript 3 and is mutable (i.e. it can     // be changed by someone else). undefined isn't really     // being passed in so we can ensure that its value is     // truly undefined. In ES5, undefined can no longer be     // modified.    // window and document are passed through as local     // variables rather than as globals, because this (slightly)     // quickens the resolution process and can be more     // efficiently minified (especially when both are     // regularly referenced in your plugin).    // Create the defaults once    var pluginName = 'defaultPluginName',        defaults = {            propertyName: ""value""        };    // The actual plugin constructor    function Plugin( element, options ) {        this.element = element;        // jQuery has an extend method that merges the         // contents of two or more objects, storing the         // result in the first object. The first object         // is generally empty because we don't want to alter         // the default options for future instances of the plugin        this.options = $.extend( {}, defaults, options) ;        this._defaults = defaults;        this._name = pluginName;        this.init();    }    Plugin.prototype.init = function () {        // Place initialization logic here        // You already have access to the DOM element and        // the options via the instance, e.g. this.element         // and this.options    };    // A really lightweight plugin wrapper around the constructor,     // preventing against multiple instantiations    $.fn[pluginName] = function ( options ) {        return this.each(function () {            if (!$.data(this, 'plugin_' + pluginName)) {                $.data(this, 'plugin_' + pluginName,                 new Plugin( this, options ));            }        });    }})( jQuery, window, document );I have included the comments so as to refer to them in my questions.I have a crude idea why window and document have been included in the argument of the anonymous function that wraps the plugin (I don't know what else to call it) because it is given in the comments that it sorta kinda shortens the execution time. But how does that work? Any argument of the said anonymous function wrapping the plugin gets passed on to where? And how are these addressed in the plugin?Normally, I would do $(window).resize(function(){}) but that doesn't work in this case. If I do console.log(window) inside the Plugin function, it says 'undefined'.Which brings me to the other question which is: what is undefined? Isn't it a data type that is assigned to an object that isn't defined in the scope? How can it be passed as an argument? Don't the arguments have to be objects? There are a few lines written about this in the comments, but I don't understand a word of it: &lt;so we can ensure that its value is truly undefined> whaaa?To sum up:What indeed is meant by function($)?Why should I include window, document and undefined as arguments of function($)?If I do it, how do I access the actual window and document objects?undefined what, and why?Please go easy on me. I never studied programming language as a subject for the express purpose of writing applications. I studied basic C for writing hardware oriented low-level routines for tiny core microcontrollers and that's just about it. I did learn C++ extensively and a bit of Java on my own. Just so you'd know what to expect.",javascript
12370,"Packing, caching, JS and CSS in PHP that differentiate between development and production environment I am trying to make development easy and have highly optimized output in production.The goals of what I am trying to do is:Make production pages fast! I would like that the Google Page Speed and YSlow return the best scores. This means:Combine and compress JS files and CSS and position the group in the right place (bottom or top of the page) in the HTML. For .js Google Closure seems the best choice..JS and .CSS are smartly cached but be sure that they get reloaded when of the .JS or CSS componet is updated. 301 File not changed etc.Cache type: I think cache on disk is fine. Consider APC and Memcache or Redis if they significantly improve speed.Capable to specify and use lazy load of .JS when necessary or at least not to block the page rendering.(Optional) Compress the HTML too.Make website development easy:   Use short command in the .php file when you want to include .js or .css and compress them only in the production environmentUse syntax like pack_js(['first.js', 'second.js' 'third.js']) and pack_css(['first.less', 'second.less' 'third.css'], true)It is easy to configure develpment or production environment. Maybe just a call to SetDebug(true or false). Default productionEasy to set up cache folders and source folders          Use of LESS to make CSS development sucks less. Automatically compile LESS files in CSS in production but use of LESS.js in development so that each time you change the .less file in development it is updated on the server.(optional) In development it includes a JS and a LESS console similar to the shell at https://www.squarefree.com/bookmarklets/webdevel.htmlNote: it is OK to use Apachee modules and .htaccess files if they significantly speed up the process. But it should be able to set them up quicky, ideally with just a setup command.Is there something that do this? Or what are the best resources to start?I would prefer a solution that consists of a PHP script (eventually few .php files, .htaccess and compressing executables) that compresses the .JS with the Google Closure Compiler and compress/compile the CSS/LESS files stripping out useless comments and white spaces. A special cookie could be used on production server to output the development version.I would like to have:A php function usable like this: pack_js(['first.js', 'second.js', 'third.js']) that write something like:On developments servers:&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""static/js/first.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""static/js/second.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""static/js/third.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;On production servers (if the special cookie is not present):&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""cache/12a42323bfe339ea9w.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;Another function: pack_css(['first.less', 'second.less', 'third.css'], true) that write something like:On developments servers:&lt;link rel=""stylesheet/less"" href=""/static/css/first.less"" type=""text/css"" /&gt;&lt;link rel=""stylesheet/less"" href=""/static/css/second.less"" type=""text/css"" /&gt;&lt;link href=""/static/css/third.css"" type=""text/css"" /&gt;&lt;script src=""http://lesscss.googlecode.com/files/less-1.0.21.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" charset=""utf-8""&gt;    less.env = ""development"";    less.watch();&lt;/script&gt;On production servers (if the special cookie is not present):&lt;link href=""/cache/46537a8b8e876f7a8e7.css"" type=""text/css"" /&gt;the second parameter specify if the less.js should be output on the development serverObviously 12a42323bfe339ea9w.js and 46537a8b8e876f7a8e7.css are the optimized, packed and  compiled version of the script. This solution should be able to detect when a source file change and recompile the scripts for production. It should be configurable to regarding locations of the script and type of caching (disk is fine). Ideally the pack_js should probably have an option to make possible lazy load of the js in production.Every suggestion is welcomed.",javascript

17389,"How can I use JavaScript within an Excel macro? There’s a really cool diff class hosted by Google here:http://code.google.com/p/google-diff-match-patch/I’ve used it before on a few web sites, but now I need to use it within an Excel macro to compare text between two cells.However, it is only available in JavaScript, Python, Java, and C++, not VBA.My users are limited to Excel 2003, so a pure .NET solution wouldn't work. Translating the code to VBA manually would take too much time and make upgrading difficult.One option I considered was to compile the JavaScript or Java source using the .NET compilers (JScript.NET or J#), use Reflector to output as VB.NET, then finally downgrade the VB.NET code manually to VBA, giving me a pure VBA solution. After having problems getting it to compile with any .NET compiler, I abandoned this path.Assuming I could have gotten a working .NET library, I could have also used ExcelDna (http://www.codeplex.com/exceldna), an open-source Excel add-in to make .NET code integration easier.My last idea was to host an Internet Explorer object, send it the JavaScript source, and calling it. Even if I got this to work, my guess is it would be dirt-slow and messy.UPDATE: Solution found!I used the WSC method described below by the accepted answer. I had to change the WSC code a little to clean up the diffs and give me back a VBA-compatible array of arrays:function DiffFast(text1, text2){    var d = dmp.diff_main(text1, text2, true);    dmp.diff_cleanupSemantic(d);    var dictionary = new ActiveXObject(""Scripting.Dictionary""); // VBA-compatible array    for ( var i = 0; i &lt; d.length; i++ ) {    dictionary.add(i, JS2VBArray(d[i]));    }    return dictionary.Items();}function JS2VBArray(objJSArray){    var dictionary = new ActiveXObject(""Scripting.Dictionary"");    for (var i = 0; i &lt; objJSArray.length; i++) {        dictionary.add( i, objJSArray[ i ] );        }    return dictionary.Items();}I registered the WSC and it worked just fine. The code in VBA for calling it is as follows:Public Function GetDiffs(ByVal s1 As String, ByVal s2 As String) As Variant()    Dim objWMIService As Object    Dim objDiff As Object    Set objWMIService = GetObject(""winmgmts:"")    Set objDiff = CreateObject(""Google.DiffMatchPath.WSC"")    GetDiffs = objDiff.DiffFast(s1, s2)    Set objDiff = Nothing    Set objWMIService = NothingEnd Function(I tried keeping a single global objWMIService and objDiff around so I wouldn't have to create/destroy these for each cell, but it didn't seem to make a difference on performance.)I then wrote my main macro. It takes three parameters: a range (one column) of original values, a range of new values, and a range where the diff should dump the results. All are assumed to have the same number of row, I don't have any serious error-checking going on here.Public Sub DiffAndFormat(ByRef OriginalRange As Range, ByRef NewRange As Range, ByRef DeltaRange As Range)    Dim idiff As Long    Dim thisDiff() As Variant    Dim diffop As String    Dim difftext As String    difftext = """"    Dim diffs() As Variant    Dim OriginalValue As String    Dim NewValue As String    Dim DeltaCell As Range    Dim row As Integer    Dim CalcMode As IntegerThese next three lines speed up the update without botching the user's preferred calculation mode later:    Application.ScreenUpdating = False    CalcMode = Application.Calculation    Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual    For row = 1 To OriginalRange.Rows.Count        difftext = """"        OriginalValue = OriginalRange.Cells(row, 1).Value        NewValue = NewRange.Cells(row, 1).Value        Set DeltaCell = DeltaRange.Cells(row, 1)        If OriginalValue = """" And NewValue = """" ThenErasing the previous diffs, if any, is important:            Erase diffsThis test is a visual shortcut for my users so it's clear when there's no change at all:        ElseIf OriginalValue = NewValue Then            difftext = ""No change.""

As the user swipes up or down the set of cards move up and down the table. There are 4 cards visible on the screen at any given time, but only the second card is showing its face. As the user swipes the second card flips back onto its face and the next card (depending on the swipe direction) lands in it's place showing its face.I have set up my card view class like this:@interface WLCard : UIView {    UIView *_frontView;    UIView *_backView;    BOOL flipped;}And I have tried flipping the card using this piece of code:- (void) flipCard {    [self.flipTimer invalidate];    if (flipped){        return;    }    id animationsBlock = ^{            self.backView.alpha = 1.0f;            self.frontView.alpha = 0.0f;            [self bringSubviewToFront:self.frontView];            flipped = YES;            CALayer *layer = self.layer;            CATransform3D rotationAndPerspectiveTransform = CATransform3DIdentity;            rotationAndPerspectiveTransform.m34 = 1.0 / 500;            rotationAndPerspectiveTransform = CATransform3DRotate(rotationAndPerspectiveTransform, M_PI, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);            layer.transform = rotationAndPerspectiveTransform;    };    [UIView animateWithDuration:0.25                          delay:0.0                        options: UIViewAnimationCurveEaseInOut                     animations:animationsBlock                     completion:nil];}This code works but it has the following problems with it that I can't seem to figure out:Only half of the card across the x-axis is animated.Once flipped, the face of the card is upside down and mirrored.Once I've flipped the card I cannot get the animation to ever run again. In other words, I can run the animation block as many times as I want, but only the first time will animate. The subsequent times I try to animate lead to just a fade in and out between the subviews.Also, bear in mind that I need to be able to interact with the face of the card. i.e. it has buttons on it.If anybody has run into these issues it would be great to see your solutions. Even better would be to add a perspective transform to the animation to give it that extra bit of realism.",ios

And I modified this example to create a GDI+ bitmap by writing the WPF image to a MemoryStream and creating the Bitmap from that. But this process is slow! Horribly slow! Opening a simple image takes around 10 seconds on my computer. This solution also requires references to the WPF assemblies and that doesn't feel right, especially not since I would like to run the code in an ASP.NET project.

Chrome downloads the data as expected when it hits the link tag in the HTML, but requests it again via XHR from our script about a second later.The server is configured to allow caching, and is responding with Cache-Control: ""max-age=3600, must-revalidate"" in the header. When Chrome requests the data again, the server responds correctly with a 304 Not Modified status.The use case is this: the config endpoint will always be requested from the Javascript in our single page application using XHR (an AngularJS resolve, in case it's relevant). However, our scripts are very large and take a long time to parse, so the JSON config will not be requested until the parsing is finished. Prefetching would allow us to use some of that parsing time to fetch and cache responses from API endpoints that would otherwise have to wait for the scripts to load.",javascript

39108,"Slow compile times with react-native iOS app I am currently working on a react-native iOS app. While developing I noticed that the compile times for the app are really slow. I got a CI hooked up which roughly does the following:clean git checkout of the applications workspace run unit testsrun UI tests build the appSince this is a clean checkout the app always recompiles all of the react static libraries which come with the React.xcodeproj like libyoga.a, libReact.a, etc. This means that a clean CI build roughly takes ~8min only to build all of the react dependencies (~4min * 2 because the UI test target rebuilds React again).I wondered whether it would be possible to speed up the compile times. I came up with the following idea but need your advice to tell me if it would work or if I am on the wrong track.Compile all static libraries for iphoneos and iphonesimulatorPut them together in a single file via lipoMove them to a folderPut that folder into version controlLink the libraries in that folder into the Xcode projectThis way it would only be necessary to build a new set of static libraries if I update the react-native version in the package.json, right ?Another idea which came to my mind is to build a dynamic framework of react-native. The framework could be build only once and then added to the application via carthage or manually. The dynamic framework would link all the react static libraries and add the correct headers to the header search paths.Does anyone can give me a hint if this could work or has an idea how to improve the build architecture in order to speed up the compile time ?",ios

1763,".NET Entity framework project layout (architecture) I'm trying to determine how best to architect a .NET Entity Framework project to achieve a nice layered approach. So far I've tried it out in a browse-based game where the players own and operate planets. Here's how I've got it:Web SiteThis contains all the front end.C# Project - MLS.Game.Data This contains the EDMX file with all my data mappings. Not much else here.C# Project - MLS.Game.Business This contains various classes that I call 'Managers' such as PlanetManager.cs.  The planet manager has various static methods that are used to interact with the planet, such as getPlanet(int planetID) which would return an generated code object from MLS.Game.Data.From the website, I'll do something like this:var planet = PlanetManager.getPlanet(1);It returns a Planet object from from the MLS.Game.Data (generated from the EDMX). It works, but it bothers me to a degree because it means that my front end has to reference MLS.Game.Data. I've always felt that the GUI should only need to reference the Business project though.  In addition, I've found that my Manager classes tend to get very heavy. I'll end up with dozens of static methods in them.So... my question is - how does everyone else lay out their ASP EF projects?EDITAfter some more though, there's additional items which bother me. For example, let's say I have my Planet object, which again is generated code from the wizard. What if a time came that my Planet needed to have a specialized property, say ""Population"" which is a calculation of some sort based on other properties of the Planet object. Would I want to create a new class that inherits from Planet and then return that instead? (hmm, I wonder if those classes are sealed by the EF?)Thanks","c#,asp.net"

However, I can't see a way to accomplish this and was wondering if anyone had any ideas. Consider the following: The above picture illustrates what I'm trying to do. I want to take the video track from four different videos and merge them into a single video such that they play in a grid-like layout. Right now, I'm able to achieve this by doing the followingCreate a single AVMutableCompositionAdd four video tracks to the mutable compositionCreate four AVMutableVideoCompositionLayerInstruction instances with the appropriate transform applied to scale and translate the track.Create an AVMutableVideoComposition, add the layer instructions to it and then set that video composition on the appropriate AVAssetExportSessionWhile this works, it doesn't offer me the ability to do any custom effects on each video track before compositing it into the output clip. For example, in the picture above I'd like to add a unique border color around each track. With a single video (and thus no layer instructions), then I can just add the border using something like AVVideoComposition applyingCIFiltersWithHandler, which works great. But I can't use that because I need the video composition for setting the transform and scale instructions. (applyingCIFiltersWithHandler doesn't appear to offer a way to get access to the tracks that make up the frame being rendered.)What I think I want is the ability to do some type of custom rendering within a AVMutableVideoCompositionLayerInstruction, but the only options currently available are transform and opacity ones. (Note that any solution requires that I have access to the current composition time during rendering for each video track  because some of the ""effects"" I'd like to render are a frame counter and a timecode display.)Any help, ideas or tips would be appreciated.",ios

38689,"Why CSS and JS files bypass Asp.Net MVC routes? I received a prototype application built with Asp.Net MVC4. It is currently replacing the default controller factory with a custom one using NInject, ServiceLocator and all.The problem is that by replacing the default controller factory, the requests to JS files are being treated as if it was a legit request for a controller and an action.So, looking at the default template create by Visual Studio, route configuration looks like this:public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes){    routes.IgnoreRoute(""{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}"");    routes.MapRoute(        name: ""Default"",        url: ""{controller}/{action}/{id}"",        defaults: new { controller = ""Home"", action = ""Index"", id =   UrlParameter.Optional }    );}After looking that, I'm asking myself: How come a request to ""/Scripts/jquery.js"" does not get interpreted by Asp.Net MVC? I mean, why doesn't it think ""Script"" is a controller and ""jquery.js"" is an action?Because the project works if I disable the controller factory override, I can only assume that the default factory is the responsible for that kind of check. And that would mean that a ""/Scripts/jquery.js"" are indeed passed to the controller factory which is something I didn't really know.Could anyone shed some light on that?What kind of treatment should one do when overriding the controller factory to avoid such problems?","c#,asp.net"

Then I click &quot;Main 1&quot;, the sub-level (Sub 1-1, Sub 1-2, Sub 1-3) will be popped up.As just mentioned, When I click &quot;Main 6&quot;, the sub-level (Sub 6-1, Sub 6-2, Sub 6-3) will be popped up.Here is the architecture of the menu:Menu   Main 1      Sub 1-1      Sub 1-2      Sub 1-3   Main 2      Sub 2-1      Sub 2-2      Sub 2-3   Main 3      Sub 3-1      Sub 3-2      Sub 3-3   Main 4      Sub 4-1      Sub 4-2      Sub 4-3   Main 5      Sub 5-1      Sub 5-2      Sub 5-3   Main 6      Sub 6-1      Sub 6-2      Sub 6-3",javascript
15973,"How to complete interactive UIViewController transition? I've been dabbling with the new iOS 7 custom transition API and looked through all the tutorials/documentation I could find but I can't seem to figure this stuff out for my specific scenario. So essentially what I'm trying to implement is a UIPanGestureRecognizer on a view where I would swipe up and transition to a VC whose view would slide up from the bottom while the current view would slide up as I drag my finger higher. I have no problem accomplishing this without the interaction transition, but once I implement the interaction (the pan gesture) I can't seem to complete the transition. Here's the relevant code from the VC that conforms to the UIViewControllerTransitionDelegate which is needed to vend the animator controllers: - (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender {    if ([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@""Swipe""]) {        NSLog(@""PREPARE FOR SEGUE METHOD CALLED"");        UIViewController *toVC = segue.destinationViewController;        [interactionController wireToViewController:toVC];        toVC.transitioningDelegate = self;        toVC.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationCustom;      }}#pragma mark UIViewControllerTransition Delegate Methods- (id &lt;UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning&gt;)animationControllerForPresentedController:  (UIViewController *)presented                                                                   presentingController:  (UIViewController *)presenting sourceController:(UIViewController *)source {    NSLog(@""PRESENTING ANIMATION CONTROLLER CALLED"");    SwipeDownPresentationAnimationController *transitionController = [SwipeDownPresentationAnimationController new];    return transitionController;}- (id &lt;UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning&gt;)animationControllerForDismissedController:(UIViewController *)dismissed {    NSLog(@""DISMISS ANIMATION CONTROLLER CALLED"");    DismissAnimatorViewController *transitionController = [DismissAnimatorViewController new];    return transitionController;}- (id &lt;UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning&gt;)interactionControllerForDismissal:(id &lt;UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning&gt;)animator {    NSLog(@""Interaction controller for dimiss method caled"");    return interactionController.interactionInProgress ? interactionController:nil;}NOTE: The interaction swipe is only for the dismissal of the VC which is why it's in the interactionControllerForDismissal methodHere's the code for the animator of the dismissal which works fine when I tap on a button to dismiss it: #import ""DismissAnimatorViewController.h""@implementation DismissAnimatorViewController- (NSTimeInterval)transitionDuration:(id &lt;UIViewControllerContextTransitioning&gt;)transitionContext {    return 1.0;}- (void)animateTransition:(id &lt;UIViewControllerContextTransitioning&gt;)transitionContext {    NSTimeInterval duration = [self transitionDuration:transitionContext];    UIViewController *toVC = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextToViewControllerKey];    UIViewController *fromVC = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextFromViewControllerKey];    CGRect initialFrameFromVC = [transitionContext initialFrameForViewController:fromVC];    UIView *containerView = [transitionContext containerView];    CGRect screenBounds = [[UIScreen mainScreen] bounds];    NSLog(@""The screen bounds is :%@"", NSStringFromCGRect(screenBounds));    toVC.view.frame = CGRectOffset(initialFrameFromVC, 0, screenBounds.size.height);    toVC.view.alpha = 0.2;    CGRect pushedPresentingFrame = CGRectOffset(initialFrameFromVC, 0, -screenBounds.size.height);    [containerView addSubview:toVC.view];    [UIView animateWithDuration:duration                          delay:0         usingSpringWithDamping:0.6          initialSpringVelocity:0                        options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseIn                     animations:^{                         fromVC.view.frame = pushedPresentingFrame;                         fromVC.view.alpha = 0.2;                         toVC.view.frame = initialFrameFromVC;                         toVC.view.alpha = 1.0;                     } completion:^(BOOL finished) {                         [transitionContext completeTransition:YES];                     }];}@endHere's the code for the UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition subclass which serves as the interaction controller:#import ""SwipeInteractionController.h""@implementation SwipeInteractionController {    BOOL _shouldCompleteTransition;    UIViewController *_viewController;}- (void)wireToViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController {    _viewController = viewController;    [self prepareGestureRecognizerInView:_viewController.view];}- (void)prepareGestureRecognizerInView:(UIView*)view {    UIPanGestureRecognizer *gesture = [[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleGesture:)];    gesture.minimumNumberOfTouches = 1.0;    [view addGestureRecognizer:gesture];}- (CGFloat)completionSpeed {    return 1 - self.percentComplete;    NSLog(@""PERCENT COMPLETE:%f"",self.percentComplete);}- (void)handleGesture:(UIPanGestureRecognizer*)gestureRecognizer {//    CGPoint translation = [gestureRecognizer translationInView:gestureRecognizer.view.superview];    CGPoint translation = [gestureRecognizer translationInView:gestureRecognizer.view.superview];    switch (gestureRecognizer.state) {        case UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan:            // 1.

13093,"How to cache using NSURLSession and NSURLCache. Not working I have a test app setup and it successfully downloads content from the network even if the user switches apps while a download is in progress. Great, now I have background downloads in place. Now I want to add caching. There is no point to me downloading images more than once, b/c of system design, given an image URL I can tell you the content behind that URL will never change. So, now I want to cache the results of my download using apple's built in in-memory/on-disk cache that I've read so much about (as opposed to me saving the file manually in NSCachesDirectory and then checking there before making new request, ick). In an attempt to get caching working on top of this working code, I added the following code:- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions{    // Override point for customization after application launch.    // Set app-wide shared cache (first number is megabyte value)    [NSURLCache setSharedURLCache:[[NSURLCache alloc] initWithMemoryCapacity:60 * 1024 * 1024                                                                diskCapacity:200 * 1024 * 1024                                                                    diskPath:nil]];    return YES;}When I create my session, I've added two NEW lines (URLCache and requestCachePolicy).// Helper method to get a single session object- (NSURLSession *)backgroundSession{    static NSURLSession *session = nil;    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;    dispatch_once(&amp;onceToken, ^{        NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration backgroundSessionConfiguration:@""com.example.apple-samplecode.SimpleBackgroundTransfer.BackgroundSession""];        configuration.URLCache = [NSURLCache sharedURLCache]; // NEW LINE ON TOP OF OTHERWISE WORKING CODE        configuration.requestCachePolicy = NSURLRequestReturnCacheDataElseLoad;  // NEW LINE ON TOP OF OTHERWISE WORKING CODE        session = [NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:configuration delegate:self delegateQueue:nil];    });    return session;}Then, just to be ultra redundant in an attempt to see caching success I switched my NSURLRequest line from// NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:downloadURL]; // Old line, I've replaced this with...NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:downloadURL cachePolicy:NSURLRequestReturnCacheDataElseLoad timeoutInterval:2*60]; // New lineNow, when I go to download the item a 2nd time, the experience is exaclty like the first!! Takes a long time to download and progress bar is animated slow and steady like an original download. I want the data in the cache immediately!! What am I missing???----------------------------UPDATE----------------------------Okay, thanks to Thorsten's answer, I've added the following two lines of code to my didFinishDownloadingToURL delegate method:- (void)URLSession:(NSURLSession *)session downloadTask:(NSURLSessionDownloadTask *)downloadTask didFinishDownloadingToURL:(NSURL *)downloadURL {    // Added these lines...    NSLog(@""DiskCache: %@ of %@"", @([[NSURLCache sharedURLCache] currentDiskUsage]), @([[NSURLCache sharedURLCache] diskCapacity]));    NSLog(@""MemoryCache: %@ of %@"", @([[NSURLCache sharedURLCache] currentMemoryUsage]), @([[NSURLCache sharedURLCache] memoryCapacity]));    /*    OUTPUTS:    DiskCache: 4096 of 209715200    MemoryCache: 0 of 62914560    */}This is great. It confirms the cache is growing. I presume since I'm using a downloadTask (downloads to file as opposed to memory), that that's why DiskCache is growing and not memory cache first? I figured everything would go to memory cache until that overflowed and then disk cache would be used and that maybe memory cache was written to disk before the OS kills the app in the background to free up memory. Am I misunderstanding how Apple's cache works?This is a step forward for sure, but the 2nd time I download the file it takes just as long as the first time (maybe 10 seconds or so) and the following method DOES get executed again:- (void)URLSession:(NSURLSession *)session downloadTask:(NSURLSessionDownloadTask *)downloadTask didWriteData:(int64_t)bytesWritten totalBytesWritten:(int64_t)totalBytesWritten totalBytesExpectedToWrite:(int64_t)totalBytesExpectedToWrite{    // This shouldn't execute the second time around should it? Even if this is supposed to get executed a second time around then shouldn't it be lightning fast? It's not.    // On all subsequent requests, it slowly iterates through the downloading of the content just as slow as the first time. No caching is apparent.

29484,"Applying rounded corners to paths/polygons I'm gathering some info for a project that has to start within a few weeks.This project contains a browser-based drawing tool where users can add predefined shapes or forming shapes themselves. Shapes must be selectable, freely scalable and rotatable with a Illustrator-like transformtool (handles).Predefined shapes that we have in mind are: rectangles, ellipses, half ellipses and (isosceles) triangles.So far so good, to achieve this I was thinking of RaphaelJS or FabricJS but... Every shape (polygon/path) must be drawn with a certain cornerradius. And the cornerradius must be maintained while scaling, so no distortion occurs. The user can specify the rounding by input.There's a few obstacles/questions:Is there some uniform mathemetical formula to apply a cornerradius to the shapes I mentioned? Or must every shape be treated as a mini-project itself? I want to return it as a path or poly, so it can be drawn with SVG or canvas.Every scale or rotate operation, by dragging the transformhandles, will result in (massive) calculations to retrieve an updated shape I think. Rectangles are the easiest to achieve and except ellipses, all the other shapes will be a lot harder to compute. Is there some way to speed up the process?I found a site where users can draw flowcharts and apply a cornerradius on almost all shapes the are offered. It works so smoothly, I can't nail how they did it.Link: https://www.lucidchart.com/ (try button)For now, I'm a bit clueless, I guess to mediocre in mathematics. Perhaps someone can push me in the right direction and share some experiences?Thanks in advance.BTW. Performance is key in this project. The ouput of the drawing must be SVG format.",javascript

6999,"Using ReactiveCocoa to track UI updates with a remote object I'm making an iOS app which lets you remotely control music in an app playing on your desktop.One of the hardest problems is being able to update the position of the ""tracker"" (which shows the time position and duration of the currently playing song) correctly. There are several sources of input here:At launch, the remote sends a network request to get the initial position and duration of the currently playing song.When the user adjusts the position of the tracker using the remote, it sends a network request to the music app to change the position of the song.If the user uses the app on the desktop to change the position of the tracker, the app sends a network request to the remote with the new position of the tracker.If the song is currently playing, the position of the tracker is updated every 0.5 seconds or so.At the moment, the tracker is a UISlider which is backed by a ""Player"" model. Whenever the user changes the position on the slider, it updates the model and sends a network request, like so:In NowPlayingViewController.m[[slider rac_signalForControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside] subscribeNext:^(UISlider *x) {    [playerModel seekToPosition:x.value];}];[RACObserve(playerModel, position) subscribeNext:^(id x) {    slider.value = player.position;}];In PlayerModel.m:@property (nonatomic) NSTimeInterval position;- (void)seekToPosition:(NSTimeInterval)position{    self.position = position;    [self.client newRequestWithMethod:@""seekTo"" params:@[positionArg] callback:NULL];}- (void)receivedPlayerUpdate:(NSDictionary *)json{    self.position = [json objectForKey:@""position""]}The problem is when a user ""fiddles"" with the slider, and queues up a number of network requests which all come back at different times. The user could be have moved the slider again when a response is received, moving the slider back to a previous value.My question: How do I use ReactiveCocoa correctly in this example, ensuring that updates from the network are dealt with, but only if the user hasn't moved the slider since?",ios

If this is wrong, then please tell me better way (eg - do the paging in the presentation layer instead of service layer,etc)Repo layer:returns IQueryable of DbSet, abstracts the db access from the presentation layerService layer:does a LINQ query on the IQueryable to filter and just get the page items as needed using skip and take and returns a IEnumerable (going to also set to List on return to avoid any DbContext lifetime issues)Presentation layer:Call the method on the Service layer (getPagedResults(filters, pageNumber, pageSize))From the looks of it I will also need to add a separate method to get the total results.

16550,"Mobile optimization: Make notification menu with position:absolute scrollable I recently bought Moltran which is fine but has a big disadvantage: The notification menu disappears on mobile devices, which is not suiteable for me. So I learned that that this can be done removing the hidden-xs class of the li notification element. This will turn &lt;li class=""dropdown hidden-xs open""&gt; to &lt;li class=""dropdown open""&gt;, which works fine. Now I stretched the small menu on the full width of the screen If the user has a smaller device for better usability:@media (max-width: 767px) {    .nav &gt; li.dropdown:not(.hidden-xs).open .dropdown-menu {        width: 100vw;    }}Everything works fine, until one thing: I'm not able to scroll in the menu. Using a modern 5"" smartphone horizontal, 3 elements at the end are hidden. Instead the scrolling will affect the background caused by the absolute position. A simple demonstration on the online demo to make it more clear: I only removed the class hidden-xs because otherwise the menu would not appear on small windows in the line &lt;li class=""dropdown hidden-xs open""&gt; as I said before. When the window is very small, its not able to see the full notification menu and the user isn't able to scroll there:As you can see, the scroll bar on the right is at the bottom, but you can't full see the notifications because the scroll bar doesn't affect this menu. I tried a few things, mainly switching to other position types because the absolute position seems to cause the issue. But nothing worked, seems like I'm in a blind end.

48604,"Always show the tip text of Slider in Extjs In Extjs 4.1.1a, How to keep the tip text of the slider always visible?Currently, the tip text is being visible whenever the user drags the bar of the slider.I searched on docs but couldn't find any related concepts.If it is not documented or not possible, then please explain me how to create the tip text manually. The tip text should move along the bar of the slider and it should not overcome or hide any other adjacent components. Here is my code which generates a simple slider:xtype:'slider',cls: 'sliderStyle',width: ""80%"",id: 'slider',value: 6,minValue: 1,maxValue: 12,useTips: true,tipText: function(thumb){    var months = ['','Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr','May','Jun','Jul','Aug','Sep','Oct','Nov','Dec'];    var value = Ext.String.format(months[thumb.value]);    return value;},Question 2: Is it atleast possible to show the tip text when hovered on the slider?PS: I also asked the same question here.EDIT 1:  I am also moving the seek bar of the slider with two adjacent buttons (&lt; and &gt;). So, care must be taken that if I move the seek bar with the adjacent buttons then the tip text should also move.EDIT 2: The tip text should be visible when hovered on the slider or the adjacent buttons.Answer: http://jsfiddle.net/WdjZn/1/",javascript

34032,"Can !important rules be used in IE's CSS expressions? Firstly, I know that CSS expressions are defunct and wrong in so many ways, and also to avoid using !important where possible. This is for a special case stylesheet.In ShortMy question is... Is there any way for a CSS expression to set the !important flag?E.g. this doesn't work:a { color:expression('red !important'); }[Edit: thanks to MarmaladeToday's comment below]. This also doesn't work:a { color:expression('red') !important; }Can this be done some other way?In DetailWhat I'm actually trying to do is mimic the inherit value in IE6 &amp; 7. This works:color:expression(    this.parentNode.currentStyle ?        this.parentNode.currentStyle.color: 'red'    );But I also want to set the !important flag, and this doesn't work:color:expression(  (    this.parentNode.currentStyle ?        this.parentNode.currentStyle.color: 'red'  ) + ' !important');I'm aware that, in JavaScript, it isn't possible to set !important via an element's style object. E.g. this won't work:element.style.color = 'red !important';However, it is possible to set !important via the element's style attribute:element.setAttribute('style', 'color:red !important;');So... are CSS expressions limited to interacting with the style object, and therefore, what I want to achieve is impossible - or is there any way for an expression to affect an element's attributes, or pass !important in some other way?Starting a BountyNo solid answers so far, so I'm starting a bounty.Ideally, I'm looking for a CSS-based solution for mimicking inherit !important in IE6 and IE7, either with or without CSS expressions. (Please do verify that your suggestions work before posting).At least, a link to some authoritative reference telling me that this is impossible would mean I could lay this train of thought to rest - I've not seen anything mentioning the use of CSS expressions with the !important rule.",javascript

42624,"Hover state is maintained during a transition even if the element has gone Consider a simple element, and its associated CSS:&lt;div id=""content""&gt;Hover me !&lt;/div&gt;#content {    width: 100px;    height: 100px;}#content:hover {    transform: translateY(500px);    transition: transform 1s 500ms;}JSFiddleThe principle is straightforward: while the element is hovered, it must go down. The problem is, when the mouse doesn't move, that the :hover state is maintained even if the element is not physically below the mouse anymore (due to the translation). The state seems to be updated only after an mouse move.Notice the cursor (a pointer) and its relative position with the element!That's a real problem when a JavaScript function must be executed only if the mouse is on an element, after a timeout:// The mouseleave event will not be called during the transition,// unless the mouse move !element.on('mouseenter', executeAfterTimeout);element.on('mouseleave', cancelTimeout);So here are my questions:Is this behaviour normal (compliant with the norms)?What are the solutions to avoid this problem?Edit : To give you a context, here is what I want to do concretely: with JavaScript, I display a tooltip when the mouse is on an element (and hide it when the mouse leaves it). But the same element can be transform-ed when the user click on it. If the user simply clicks without moving the mouse, the tooltip will remain displayed, which is a real problem.

I'd like to support the ability for users to export their current view to a PNG image and/or an SVG document. I'd really like the SVG document to be as simple as possible (without a lot of nested transforms). Is there any framework that already supports this?I'm currently asking my users to use the Ctrl+Alt+PrntScrn technique, and I don't want to ask them to install any software/plugins.

So when running bootRun, it gets really slow and sometimes can't even refresh the files.

30859,"Dynamic C#.NET Webservice I am using a class in a C# ASP.NET project to allow a script written in some random scripting language to expose webservice methods dynamically - in other words, the script should be able to expose a method of any name with any signature (as long as it's valid, anyway) to the outside world through this SOAP interface (able to add and remove them at will, without needing a hard code change), and as such I need to be able to create a webservice class in C# while being able to dynamically add and remove methods at runtime.Now, the best plan I've been able to come up with so far is (runtime) generating C# code to represent the webservice, using System.Reflection.Emit to compile it and then loading the assembly at runtime - all whenever the script adds or removes a method to/from the service (should not happen very often, mind).Does anyone have a better idea than this?","c#,asp.net"
20458,"Why couldn't popular JavaScript runtimes handle synchronous-looking asynchronous script? As cowboy says down in the comments here, we all want to ""write [non-blocking JavaScript] asynchronous code in a style similar to this: try  {    var foo = getSomething();   // async call that would normally block    var bar = doSomething(foo);      console.log(bar);  }  catch (error)  {    console.error(error); }""So people have come up solutions to this problem like callback libraries (eg async) promises event patternsstreamlinedomains and generators.But none of these lead to code as simple and easy to understand as the sync-style code above. So why isn't possible for javascript compilers/interpreters to just NOT block on the statements we currently know as ""blocking""?  So why isn't possible for javascript compilers/interpreters to handle the sync syntax above AS IF we'd written it in an async style?""For example, upon processing getSomething() above, the compiler/interpreter could just say ""this statement is a call to [file system/network resource/...], so I'll make a note to listen to responses from that call and in the meantime get on with whatever's in my event loop"". When the call returns, execution can proceed to doSomething().You would still maintain all of the basic features of popular JavaScript runtime environmentssingle threadedevent loop blocking operations (I/O, network, wait timers) handled ""asynchronously""This would be simply a tweak to the syntax, that would allow the interpreter to pause execution on any given bit of code whenever IT DETECTS an async operation, and instead of needing callbacks, code just continues from the line after the async call when the call returns.As Jeremy says   there is nothing in the JavaScript runtime that will preemptively  pause the execution of a given task, permit some other code to execute  for a while, and then resume the original taskWhy not? (As in, ""why couldn't there be?""... I'm not interested in a history lesson)Why does a developer have to care about whether a statement is blocking or not? Computers are for automating stuff that humans are bad at (eg writing non-blocking code).  You could perhaps implement it with a statement like ""use noblock""; (a bit like ""use strict"";) to turn this ""mode"" on for a whole page of code. EDIT: ""use noblock""; was a bad choice, and misled some answerers that I was trying to change the nature of common JavaScript runtimes altogether. Something like 'use syncsyntax'; might better describe it.some kind of parallel(fn, fn, ...); statement allowing you to run things in parallel while in ""use syncsyntax""; mode - eg to allow multiple async activities to be kicked off at onceEDIT: a simple sync-style syntax wait(), which would be used instead of setTimeout() in ""use syncsyntax""; modeEDIT: As an example, instead of writing (standard callback version)function fnInsertDB(myString, fnNextTask) {  fnDAL('insert into tbl (field) values (' + myString + ');', function(recordID) {    fnNextTask(recordID);  });}fnInsertDB('stuff', fnDeleteDB);You could write'use syncsyntax';function fnInsertDB(myString) {  return fnDAL('insert into tbl (field) values (' + myString ');');  // returns recordID}var recordID = fnInsertDB('stuff'); fnDeleteDB(recordID);The syncsyntax version would process exactly the same way as the standard version, but it's much easier to understand what the programmer intended (as long as you understand that syncsyntax pauses execution on this code as discussed).",javascript

The report displays all results in a GridView, and I used JavaScript to read the contents of the GridView row-by-row into an Excel object.  The JavaScript goes on to create a PivotTable on a different worksheet.   Unfortunately I didn't expect that the size of the GridView would cause overloading problems with the browser if more than a few days are returned.  The application has a few thousand records per day, let's say 60k per month, and ideally I'd like to be able to return all results for up to a year. The number of rows is causing the browser to hang or crash.We're using ASP.NET 3.5 on Visual Studio 2010 with SQL Server and the expected browser is IE8.  The report consists of a gridview that gets data from one out of a handful of stored procedures depending on which population the user chooses. The gridview is in an UpdatePanel:&lt;asp:UpdatePanel ID=""update_ResultSet"" runat=""server""&gt;&lt;Triggers&gt;    &lt;asp:AsyncPostBackTrigger ControlID=""btn_Submit"" /&gt;&lt;/Triggers&gt;&lt;ContentTemplate&gt;&lt;asp:Panel ID=""pnl_ResultSet"" runat=""server"" Visible=""False""&gt;    &lt;div runat=""server"" id=""div_ResultSummary""&gt;        &lt;p&gt;This Summary Section is Automatically Completed from Code-Behind&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;asp:GridView ID=""gv_Results"" runat=""server""             HeaderStyle-BackColor=""LightSkyBlue""             AlternatingRowStyle-BackColor=""LightCyan""              Width=""100%""&gt;        &lt;/asp:GridView&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/asp:Panel&gt;&lt;/ContentTemplate&gt;&lt;/asp:UpdatePanel&gt;I was relatively new to my team, so I followed their typical practice of returning the sproc to a DataTable and using that as the DataSource in the code behind:    List&lt;USP_Report_AreaResult&gt; areaResults = new List&lt;USP_Report_AreaResult&gt;();    areaResults = db.USP_Report_Area(ddl_Line.Text, ddl_Unit.Text, ddl_Status.Text, ddl_Type.Text, ddl_Subject.Text, minDate, maxDate).ToList();    dtResults = Common.LINQToDataTable(areaResults);    if (dtResults.Rows.Count &gt; 0)    {        PopulateSummary(ref dtResults);        gv_Results.DataSource = dtResults;        gv_Results.DataBind();(I know what you're thinking!  But yes, I have learned much more about parameterization since then.)The LINQToDataTable function isn't anything special, just converts a list to a datatable.With a few thousand records (up to a few days), this works fine.  The GridView displays the results, and there's a button for the user to click which launches the JScript exporter.  The external JavaScript function reads each row into an Excel sheet, and then uses that to create a PivotTable.  The PivotTable is important! function exportToExcel(sMyGridViewName, sTitleOfReport, sHiddenCols) {//sMyGridViewName = the name of the grid view, supplied as a text//sTitleOfReport = Will be used as the page header if the spreadsheet is printed//sHiddenCols = The columns you want hidden when sent to Excel, separated by semicolon (i.e. 1;3;5).//              Supply an empty string if all columns are visible.var oMyGridView = document.getElementById(sMyGridViewName);//If no data is on the GridView, display alert.if (oMyGridView == null)    alert('No data for report');else {    var oHid = sHiddenCols.split("";"");  //Contains an array of columns to hide, based on the sHiddenCols function parameter    var oExcel = new ActiveXObject(""Excel.Application"");    var oBook = oExcel.Workbooks.Add;    var oSheet = oBook.Worksheets(1);    var iRow = 0;    for (var y = 0; y &lt; oMyGridView.rows.length; y++)    //Export all non-hidden rows of the HTML table to excel.    {        if (oMyGridView.rows[y].style.display == '') {            var iCol = 0;            for (var x = 0; x &lt; oMyGridView.rows(y).cells.length; x++) {                var bHid = false;                for (iHidCol = 0; iHidCol &lt; oHid.length; iHidCol++) {                    if (oHid[iHidCol].length !=0 &amp;&amp; oHid[iHidCol] == x) {                        bHid = true;                        break;                     }                 }                if (!bHid) {                    oSheet.Cells(iRow + 1, iCol + 1) = oMyGridView.rows(y).cells(x).innerText;                    iCol++;                }            }            iRow++;        }    }What I'm trying to do: Create a solution (probably client-side) that can handle this data and process it into Excel.  Someone might suggest using the HtmlTextWriter, but afaik that doesn't allow for automatically generating a PivotTable and creates an obnoxious pop-up warning....What I've tried:Populating a JSON object -- I still think this has potential but I haven't found a way of making it work.Using a SQLDataSource -- I can't seem to use it to get any data back out. Paginating and looping through the pages -- Mixed progress.

26002,"Scheduling local notification from within a Today extension I'm making an app that contains a Today Extension. The today extension displays a list of timers, and if the user selects one of the timers, I'd like to create and schedule a local notification for that timer.My problem is that scheduling of notifications is done with this line of code:UIApplication.sharedApplication().scheduleLocalNotification(notification)which very unfortunately relies on UIApplication.sharedApplication() that is not accessible from an extension.So my question is: How can I schedule a local notification from within a Today extension?Funnily enough, I can make a framework with the code shared between my app and my extension and in that framework I can call:func schedule() {    // ...    let settings = UIUserNotificationSettings(forTypes: .Sound | .Alert, categories: nil)    UIApplication.sharedApplication().registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)    // ...    UIApplication.sharedApplication().scheduleLocalNotification(notification)    // ...}If I then import that framework from my extension and call schedule() I get this output:Failed to inherit CoreMedia permissions from 13636: (null)Attempting to schedule a local notification &lt;UIConcreteLocalNotification: 0x7feaf3657a00&gt;{fire date = Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 1:01:48 PM Western European Standard Time, time zone = (null), repeat interval = 0, repeat count = UILocalNotificationInfiniteRepeatCount, next fire date = Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 1:01:48 PM Western European Standard Time, user info = (null)} with an alert but haven't received permission from the user to display alertsAttempting to schedule a local notification &lt;UIConcreteLocalNotification: 0x7feaf3657a00&gt;{fire date = Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 1:01:48 PM Western European Standard Time, time zone = (null), repeat interval = 0, repeat count = UILocalNotificationInfiniteRepeatCount, next fire date = Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 1:01:48 PM Western European Standard Time, user info = (null)} with a sound but haven't received permission from the user to play soundsSo a module running in an extension has access to UIApplication.sharedApplication() since this code actually tries to schedule a notification, but the system is not prepared for an extension asking for permissions to display alerts and so it fails (that's what it seems anyway).How can I solve this?Also, I know I can just launch my app using an url and schedule the notification from the app as normal, but that is not user firendly. The whole purpose of having the today extension is so that the user doesn't have to open the app to schedule the notification. The interaction has to be quick, simple and transparent and yanking the user out of the app they're in just to run a few lines of code and then be done with it is not how I want to do things.",ios

33073,"iPhone alarm using repeated local notifications I'm trying to add an in-background alarm clock feature to an app I'm developing.I have read up on the UILocalNotification object and its use, and am aware that it is limited to 30 seconds of audio.I was thinking of scheduling multiple notifications (say, 5 of them) spaced 30 seconds apart to mimic continuous play, but the problem with this approach is that if the user hits Close, I won't be able to cancel any of the subsequent notifications.As far as I know, it is impossible to remove or hide the Close button without hiding the notification entirely (i.e., setting the alertBody property to Nil).So, I thought I might use the repeatInterval property to cause the notification to pop up every 30 seconds, but it seems that I can only set the interval to one minute or one second, and nothing in between.The feature is meant to allow the user to choose between music and beeps for alarm audio; it seems I may have found a way to do the beeps - setting the repeatInterval to one second, create a second's worth of beeps (which would need to be timed to cleanly repeat) and use that as the notification sound.However, for the music, this approach limits me to playing 30 seconds of audio, followed by a 30-second gap, followed by 30 seconds of audio, and so on.I know that there is no straightforward solution here, from my reading of other posts and resources; no third-party app has access to the same functionality as the built-in alarm clock.  I am hoping that someone has found a workaround or thinks of something really clever.UPDATE: I have found that the repeatInterval doesn't help me in this case, as I can't cancel the repetitions without launching the app.For the time being I have decided not to use a notification as an alarm per se, but have changed the feature to be a reminder (more along the lines of what the notification is intended for).If I come up with a way to implement user-friendly, reliable alarm functionality to an app, I will update this post.",ios

I am lost on how to get my pipeline to run my test without issues. I saw that the release pipeline you have the options of running tests too.

It works on my local machine but not in the build pipeline. To get it to work, I had to do three things:Log in to Azure. Setup a new app registration in Azure ADIn your new AD app registration, create a new client secretProvide your new AD App access to your key vault. Go into your key vault access policies and add the app that you created in your AD with read access to your secrets.Modified my call to AzureServiceTokenProvier() in my Program.cs file as follows: var azureServiceTokenProvider = new AzureServiceTokenProvider(""connectionString={your key vault endpoint};RunAs=App;AppId={your app id that you setup in Azure AD};TenantId={your azure subscription};AppKey={your client secret key}"")Note that your client secret has to be formatted correctly. The app registrations (preview) generates a random secret key. Sometimes this key does not work in the connection string (throws an error as incorrectly formatted). Either try generating your own key in the non-preview version of app registration or generate a new key and try again.After that I was able to run my integration test in my build pipeline successfully and create a release to my web app in Azure. I'm not satisfied with this approach because although it works, its exposing a secret value in the code itself. Manages service identity does not need to be turned on due to above approach. I feel that this is extremely bad in that regard.There has to be a better way than this. One option is not to run the integration test in the build pipeline. Not sure if this is the correct approach. I'm still hoping someone will be able to provide a better approach to this or explain if my approach is okay to use. ","c#,asp.net"

2523,"Best way to download and process a Very Large Compressed MS Access File to be loaded in Oracle I have to download a 250mb~ ZIP File password encrypted through FTP. After downloaded I have to unzip it with a common password, the Zip file would contain an 1.5GB MS Access DB that I have to read and make some joins with some tables in my DB Oracle and transform and load that Data into that Oracle DB.I'm looking for the best way to do this process. I'm a c# developer, so my first thought was to use c#, download the file via FtpClient or FtpWebRequest, then use a zip library like DotNetZip and open the MS Access dataBase via ODBC and load the records into Oracle with ODP.NEt, I think that's is my ""easy way"", cuz I know how to do it.But since this a big file and I know this could take a long time, I'm concerned about time and efficiency and how to reduce the time of this process.So I'm thinking that processing all the request directly into oracle(download the FTP from there, unzip it there, and process the information directly in there would reduce times like passing record by record from c# to oracle) should reduce the time of this process, but I'm not sure if this is the correct way of doing this.So I started to look into librarys from oracle that could do what I'm trying to archieve and I found the PLSQL-utils and seems like they can do everything that I need except reading the MS Access DataBase and I started looking about that and found the Heterogeneous Services but I have never used them so I'm little lost about that.Also I heard once that I could use Java directly from Oracle, and I know java can connect to MS Access via JDBC. So I searched about that and found something about Calling Java Methods in Oracle DatabaseThat's what I have so far, but I don't know which method should I use, I mean, RDBMS as far as I know, are meant for processing data but not for programming things like downloading files or something like that, that's why we have OOP's languages.As an additional information, this process is going to execute once or twice for month so I have to schedule it, if it is in oracle, can easily be done with an schedule job, or in c# with a Scheduled Task or Windows Service (those are the tools that I know)Some restrictions that I haveMy client don't have a MS SQL Server and neither can buy a license for it (So I cannot use DTSX for this process)In the Oracle production server maybe I won't have enough permissions to do all the things, but I can comply for those if they are the best for the processIf a backend server (Java, c# hosted on IIS or WebLogic or JBoss or anykind) is going to be required, this Server and the Oracle Server would be differentsOracle database hosted on Unix ServerBeing said all of this, how can I efficiently do all this process, should I use .net and load record by record in my Oracle DataBase?

16029,"How do I reset after a UIScrollView zoom? I have a Graph being drawn inside a UIScrollView.  It's one large UIView using a custom subclass of CATiledLayer as its layer.When I zoom in and out of the UIScrollView, I want the graph to resize dynamically like it does when I return the graph from viewForZoomingInScrollView.  However, the Graph redraws itself at the new zoom level, and I want to reset the transform scale to 1x1 so that the next time the user zooms, the transform starts from the current view.  If I reset the transform to Identity in scrollViewDidEndZooming, it works in the simulator, but throws an EXC_BAD_ACCSES on the device.This doesn't even solve the issue entirely on the simulator either, because the next time the user zooms, the transform resets itself to whatever zoom level it was at, and so it looks like, if I was zoomed to 2x, for example, it's suddenly at 4x.  When I finish the zoom, it ends up at the correct scale, but the actual act of zooming looks bad.So first: how do I allow the graph to redraw itself at the standard scale of 1x1 after zooming, and how do I have a smooth zoom throughout?Edit: New findingsThe error seems to be ""[CALayer retainCount]: message sent to deallocated instance""I'm never deallocating any layers myself.  Before, I wasn't even deleting any views or anything.  This error was being thrown on zoom and also on rotate.

32590,"Integrating Automated Web Testing Into Build Process I'm looking for suggestions to improve the process of automating functional testing of a website. Here's what I've tried in the past.I used to have a test project using WATIN. You effectively write what look like ""unit tests"" and use WATIN to automate a browser to click around your site etc.Of course, you need a site to be running. So I made the test actually copy the code from my web project to a local directory and started a web server pointing to that directory before any of the tests run.That way, someone new could simply get latest from our source control and run our build script, and see all the tests run. They could also simply run all the tests from the IDE.The problem I ran into was that I spent a lot of time maintaining the code to set up the test environment more than the tests. Not to mention that it took a long time to run because of all that copying. Also, I needed to test out various scenarios including installation, meaning I needed to be able to set the database to various initial states.I was curious on what you've done to automate functional testing to solve some of these issues and still keep it simple.MORE DETAILSSince people asked for more details, here it is. I'm running ASP.NET using Visual Studio and Cassini (the built in web server). My unit tests run in MbUnit (but that's not so important. Could be NUnit or XUnit.NET). Typically, I have a separate unit test framework run all my WATIN tests. In the AssemblyLoad phase, I start the webserver and copy all my web application code locally.I'm interested in solutions for any platform, but I may need more descriptions on what each thing means. :)",asp.net

12770,"Is it possible to edit the volume and pan of a video's audio-track and export to a stand-alone video with that information? I'm recording video in my app. When the video is recorded, I want to let the user preview the recording with controls for changing volume and panning of the audio track. To preview the video recording, I'm using an AVMutableComposition and adding the AVAsset from the recorded file's local URL, and using the Composition as an AVPlayerItem to play through AVPlayer. I am doing this because I want to add volume and pan-""filters(?)"" to the audio tracks in the composition, and later export the entire composition. Playback is working perfectly, but I can't find any way to add such ""filters"" (to change the volume or the panning of the AVAssetTrack or anything else on this level). So far, I've only been able to change the volume on playback by using this: NSMutableArray *audioParam = [NSMutableArray array];    AVMutableAudioMixInputParameters *audioInputParams = [AVMutableAudioMixInputParameters audioMixInputParameters]; [audioInputParams setVolume:volumeSlider.value atTime:kCMTimeZero]; [audioInputParams setTrackID:[audioTrack trackID]]; [audioParam addObject:audioInputParams]; AVMutableAudioMix *audioMix = [AVMutableAudioMix audioMix]; [audioMix setInputParameters:audioParam]; [playerItem setAudioMix:audioMix];Here, I believe, that I'm only changing the representation of the composition, and not the composition itself. When the user is happy with the level of volume and pan, he should click ""Accept"", and I will export the composition to a stand alone movie-file (I.E it won't make any difference to the composition if I change the volume of the player this way).Is there a way to add the source movie to an AVComposition, change the volume/pan of the audio, and export to a new file with the new information?I'm also, as mentioned, looking for this for panning an audio stereo or mono track, but I can't find anything at all. The only mentioning of panning in Apple Docs is by using AVAudioPlayer, which I can't use as this is a video-file. Also, changing pan in the player would do nothing good just as I explained with volume. Is there really no way to change panning through either AVAsset, AVAssetTrack, AVComposition or anything to do with this?I was thinking I might have to do it manually, by reducing the volume on each channel for a stereo audio track, but I can't find any way to do this either.Simply put; I'm looking for a way to change the volume- and pan(left/right)-level of the audio-track of a single video(prefferably during preview/playback of said video), and then be able to export this video to a new video-file, which then will have this new volume- and pan-information as source information.Example: 1. Record Video. 2. Preview Video.3. Set Pan of audio to far left (audio only in left channel), and Volume to 20%4. Export video with new information5. If I now upload this video-file to internet, and sombody downloads it on any device/computer, it will only have sound in the left speaker, and it will be fairly low volume.",ios

327,How to get the same time the update(currentTime:) function uses? (before it is called) Question: The update(currentTime:) function in SKScene is called every frame with a currentTime argument. I'm wondering how to get the time from the same source update(currentTime:) uses without using the update function. I only found CFAbsoluteTimeGetCurrent() which is different.Reason: To calculate timeSinceLastUpdate you need an instance variable called timeOfLastUpdate. To implement timeOfLastUpdate you need to set it to an arbitrary value before the first update which makes the first calculation of timeSinceLastUpdate incorrect. You could have a simple if statement to detect this or use optionals but that is an unneeded branch which could be avoided if I just set timeOfLastUpdate in didMoveToView(view:).

16811,"Sharing the `node_modules` folder between the container and the host This is a pretty hot topic, but I've never actually found a solution.As you probably know, when we have a volume in a container and we install the dependencies (with npm i or something) from a Dockerfile (with default perms), Npm will create a node_modules folder in the container with root:root access.I'm facing two issues with this method (on a local/dev environment):The node_modules folder only exists inside the container, but the host's IDE/LSPs needs this folder to work properly (module imports, type definitions, etc).If the host wants to install/update a package (npm i ..., etc) he will have to restart and rebuild the container for the node_modules folder to be updated.So I came up with another idea, what if I install the dependencies using CMD in a Dockerfile (or the command property of a service in a docker-compose file) and use a volume so the node_modules can be shared with the host. Unfortunately, this method introduces new issues. For instance, the node_modules has a root:root permissions access, so if your host's username is &quot;named&quot; otherwise and doesn't have the same uid &amp; gid you will need to run root access commands update the node_modules (sudo npm i ...).Here is my current config:docker-compose.yml:version: '3.7'services:  app:    container_name: 'app_DEV'    build: .    command: sh -c &quot;yarn install &amp;&amp; node ./server.js&quot;    volumes:      - ./:/usr/src/app    ports:      - 3000:3000    tty: trueDockerfile:FROM node:12.8.1-alpineWORKDIR /usr/src/appCOPY . .package.json:{  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {    &quot;express&quot;: &quot;^4.17.1&quot;  }}server.js:const app = require('express')();app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {  res.send('Hello');});app.listen(3000, () =&gt; console.log('App is listening on port 3000'));Then you can try to run docker-compose up and do a ls -la:-rw-r--r--  1 mint mint   215 août  23 16:39 docker-compose.yml-rw-r--r--  1 mint mint    56 août  23 16:29 Dockerfiledrwxr-xr-x 52 root root  4096 août  23 16:31 node_modules-rw-r--r--  1 mint mint    53 août  23 16:31 package.json-rw-r--r--  1 mint mint   160 août  23 16:29 server.jsAs you can see every files/folders have mint:mint access except node_modules (mint is my host's user).So to sum up my question: is there a better way to manage NodeJS dependencies with Docker containers?",javascript

3203,"Best Approach For Checking Internet Connection in iOS I have been searching through internet to find the best way to check for internet connection in iOS that works for both in IPv4 and IPv6 network environment. I found there are many possible answers but very confused on which one to apply. What I need to do is the following:   // Check for internet connectionif (internetConnectionIsAvailable) {   // make rest calls}else   // show cached data}I found the following options that are suggested in internet.OPTION 1:Use apple Reachability classWith Reachability I can check internet connectivity as following which is short and direct, and don't have to wait for any response. - (BOOL)connected    {        Reachability *reachability = [Reachability reachabilityForInternetConnection];        NetworkStatus networkStatus = [reachability currentReachabilityStatus];        return !(networkStatus == NotReachable);    }- (void)viewDidLoad {    [super viewDidLoad];    if (![self connected]){     // Not connected    }else{    // Connected    }}But here internet checking is done at pre-flight, which is against suggestion by apple engineer as seen on WWDC video. Also if you check ReadMe.md, it has been mentioned that Reachability fully supports IPv6. But if method reachabilityForInternetConnection is checked in Reachability.m they have used sockaddr_in, sockaddr_in6 has not been used which is recommended for IPv6 network. So I don't know if it will work in IPv6 network.OPTION 2: Use Alamofire to connect Just try to connect as in one of stackoverflow answer. The code also shown below:-Alamofire.request(.GET,""http://superrandomdomainnamethatisnotused.com/superrandompath"").responseString {    (request, response, stringData, error) in    if let networkError = error {        if (networkError.code == -1009) {            println(""No Internet \(error)"")        }    }}But isn't it time consuming to try to connect to some host, wait for the response and then know if online/offline. OPTION 3: Use Tony Million's version of Reachability. But the author has warned of app being rejected while using this. I can use this as code shown below:-// Checks if we have an internet connection or not- (void)testInternetConnection{       internetReachableFoo = [Reachability reachabilityWithHostname:@""www.google.com""];    // Internet is reachable    internetReachableFoo.reachableBlock = ^(Reachability*reach)    {        // Update the UI on the main thread        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{            NSLog(@""There in internet connection"");        });    };    // Internet is not reachable    internetReachableFoo.unreachableBlock = ^(Reachability*reach)    {        // Update the UI on the main thread        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{            NSLog(@""Someone broke the internet :("");        });    };    [internetReachableFoo startNotifier];}But in this option, my question is, is this right approach to test internet by connecting http://google.com . Does this guarantee 100% results? What if google is down? If the app is used in country where google.com is not allowed whats the result? So I have been in a big dilemma which option to choose, if these options are the right way or is there a better way of checking internet which guarantee 100% results and works in both IPv4 and IPv6 network. Can anyone suggest me which option is better or should I go for other approach, what is the better way to accomplish this. Your reply will be much appreciated.",ios

6410,"How to allow multiple authentication methods in ASP.NET? I'm building a new ASP.NET MVC application (in C#) and one of the requirements is to create a new database of members. For this, we'd need roles to manage the different types of members and profiles to manage the additional metadata attached to each member. So far so good, just use the standard MembershipProvider, RoleProvider and ProfileProvider provided as part of the .NET Framework.However, the catch is that I'd like to allow different authentication methods. I'd like Accounts and Login Credentials to have a one-to-many relationship (one account can have a number of login credentials attached). A user for example, might have both an OpenID and ActiveDirectory account attached to their account.However, after experimenting with a few ways we opted for the MembershipProvider route (explained how it was achieved as an answer below). My question is, how have people done this before and how would people suggest I approach it? It appears to be something that is achieved on quite a number of sites, yet a search on here doesn't return anything solid to play around with.EDIT: After looking around for a good period of hours overnight and this morning - I'm still not convincinced that butchering a single MembershipProvider would have been the easiest option. Does having multiple MembershipProviders give the same effect?BOUNTY EDIT: With no responses, I am assuming that there is no more optimal solution that the one I posted as an answer. Is this really the case? I'm offering a bounty to try and see if anyone has any further thoughts on this and whether there are better alternatives.BOUNTY ACCEPT EDIT: I think that WIF is the answer as accepted below, for a .NET 4 release and maybe other versions as it probably works with 3.5. Other than that, maybe a butchered MembershipProvider or adapted one may still be relevant.","c#,asp.net"

So I have an ExpandoObject that contains other ExpandoObjects.So what I want to be able to do is this:account.features.GetProperty(""isEmailEnabled"");and have that return true.The reason is that I have many features, and I want to be able to write one generic getter method where I can pass in the name of the feature I want, and the method will pass me back the value for account.features.whatever (where ""whatever"" is specified by passing in a string to the generic getter method).

4918,".NET WebApi HttpClient not sending Windows Authentication credentials to same domain I am using multiple intranet APIs to try to build out some applications that have some services that are shared by all of the applications. A lot of these services can be called directly from the GUI using Javascript requests, however a couple of the services need to be called by the other server applications.All of the front ends and APIs are using Windows Authentication. Right now I've got it set to authorize any Windows authenticated user. Anonymous authentication is disabled.I'm using HttpClient to connect to the needed service from within the web code. Here's an example:HttpClient client = new HttpClient(new HttpClientHandler() { UseDefaultCredentials = true });client.BaseAddress = new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""OtherServiceUrl""]);client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(    new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue(""application/json""));SomeResponseObject responseObject;HttpResponseMessage response = client.GetAsync(""SomeController"").Result;if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode){    responseObject = response.Content.ReadAsAsync&lt;SomeResponseObject&gt;().Result;}else{    throw new ApplicationException(""API request not successful"");}The good news is that this works just fine when I'm running the services locally. The bad news is that when I deploy to IIS, the call to the web service fails with a Unauthorized response.After a lot of fiddling around, I realized the only time that I get an Unauthorized response is when the domain of the target API is the same as the domain of the calling application. It worked on my local box because IIS express assigns a new port to each application. The matching domain situation occurred in IIS because I created both the calling application and the API as applications under the same site in IIS, so the two applications look like directories in the same domain. It's almost like HttpClient doesn't bother to send over the authentication from the calling web application if it notices that the domains match.I created a new site on the same server but bound to a different port and put the API there instead and tried again. Sure enough, that resolves the problem, the request from the API passes through just fine.I can put in a bunch of sub domains to handle all of these different services, or just rely on using different ports in order to make the domains for these services unique, but it seems odd to me that this limitation is in place. Does anyone know if there's a property I can set on the handler or client or something else I can do to allow applications running on the same IIS site to talk to each other via HttpClient when Windows Authentication is used?Thanks!Per Sachin's suggestion, I also tried adding this to the webconfig of the application that makes the API request via HttpClient:&lt;system.net&gt;  &lt;defaultProxy useDefaultCredentials=""true"" /&gt;&lt;/system.net&gt;Still no luck.","c#,asp.net"

So my question is this:  How can I have all sprites on the screen react to the same event when touched?For my program, the same event needs to be run for all objects of the same type, so that should make it a tad easier.  I tried making a subclass of CCNode and over write the method, but that just didn't work at all... so I'm doing something wrong. Help would be appreciated!Going through the ""Touches"" project in cocos2D and seeing if I see how they did it.

22008,"Conceptual problems with IndexedDB (relationships etc.) I'm writing a thesis about offline abilities of web applications. My task is to show the possibilities of offline storage through a web application with a server-side relational database and Ajax/JSON traffic between client and server. My first implementation used an approach with localStorage, saving each Ajax response as value with the request URL as  key. The app works just fine. In the next step however, I want to (i.e. the thesis requires) implement a more advanced version with a client-side database. Since the server maintains a relational database, Web SQL Database would have been the intuitive choice. But, as we know, the standard is deprecated and I don't want to use a technology whose future is uncertain. Thus, I want to use IndexedDB to implement client-side database logic. Unfortunately, after reading a lot of material on the web that mostly keeps very much scratching the surface (todo-notes applications etc.), I still don't know how to proceed. My task seems rather straightforward:  implement the server-side database on the client with IndexedDB to replicate all data that was once fetched from the server. The problems, which make this far less straightforward are:The server-side database is relational, IndexedDB is (more or less) object-orientedThere is no intuitive way to synchronize client- and server-side databasesThere is no intuitive way to implement the relationships in IndexedDB that are implemented with foreign keys and JOINs on the serverRight now, I have a concept in mind which I'm really afraid to start to implement. I thought about creating an object store for every table in the server-database and program the relations objects in different object stores manually. In my application, which, in short, manages courses of a university, I'd have 7 object stores. I want to demonstrate my idea with an example for a JSON response from the server (/* these are comments */):{ ""course"": { /* course object */    ""id"":1,     ""lecturer"": { ""id"":""1"", /* lecturer object with many attributes */ },    ""semester"": { ""id"":""1"", /* semester object with many attributes */ },     /* more references and attributes */}}The algorithm to store the data with IndexedDB would store each object that applies to an object store in the appropriate object store and replace the objects with references to these objects. For example, the above course object would look like the following in the object store 'course':{ ""course"": { /* course object */    ""id"":1,     ""lecturer"":     { ""reference"": { /* reference to the lecturer in the object store 'lecturer' */        ""objectstore"":""lecturer"",        ""id"":""1"" }    },    ""semester"":    { ""reference"": { /* reference to the semester in the object store 'semester' */        ""objectstore"":""semester"",        ""id"":""1"" }    }    /* more references and attributes */}}The algorithm to retrieve data with IndexedDB would then do the following (I have a recursive pattern vaguely in mind):Retrieve the course object with id=1 from the object store 'course'For each reference object in the retrieved course object, do   Retrieve the object with id=reference.id from the object store reference.objectstore   Replace the reference object with the retrieved objectIt is clearly visible that this implementation would be really cumbersome, especially due to the asynchronous nature of IndexedDB. It would also result in many different transactions to the database just to retrieve a course object and performance would suffer a lot (I don't really know what the performance of IndexedDB transactions looks like anyway).How could I do this better and simpler?I already looked at these threads which represent similar problems: link1, link2. I don't see any simpler solutions in these. Moreover, I'd prefer to avoid using an IndexedDB wrapper framework due to several reasons.I could also imagine that I'm totally on the wrong track with IndexedDB for my problem.Edit:I finally ended up pursuing my approach to store the references in the objects themselves in the IndexedDB. This can result in some performance problems in cases of large amounts of data with many references. If used smartly, however, tremendous amounts of iteration and database hits can be avoided in most cases, and there is no need to store a complex database schema in memory or in the IndexedDB itself.Generally I must say, that I get the impression that I'm misinterpreting the dynamic and straight idea with IndexedDB as a schemaless database in some way. But whatever, I implemented everything in JavaScript, it works fine and there is no chance for any inconsistencies.",javascript

22782,"Best way to store an object in the view for state persistence in MVC 3? I am using ASP.NET MVC 3 and I have a C# object that I need to maintain between requests. It maintains some server-side state information that is not really important to this question. Currently this object is serialized into session and then pulled out upon each request.The problem with this approach is that the object is specific to session, but I'd like it to be specific to each request. So opening a second tab in your browser would essentially have its own object, rather than sharing the same object as the first tab because it's the same session.So obviously I need to store this object on the page and pass it back with requests. I'm wondering what the best way to go about this is. The client does not need the information in this object and the data in this object is not sensitive data so I'm not trying to prevent it from being viewed by visitors. I am simply wondering what the best way to store this object between request is. Is there a simple way to serialize a C# object into a view, say like in a hidden field (similar to web forms viewstate) and then grab it back out on each request?","c#,asp.net"

5582,"Variables set during $.getJSON function only accessible within function This may be more of a scoping question. I'm trying to set a JSON object within a $.getJSON function, but I need to be able to use that object outside of the callback.var jsonIssues = {};  // declare json variable$.getJSON(""url"", function(data) {    jsonIssues = data.Issues;});// jsonIssues not accessible hereA similar question like this one was asked in another post, and the consensus was that anything I need to do with the JSON objects needs to be done within the callback function, and cannot be accessed anywhere else. Is there really no way that I can continue to access/manipulate that JSON object outside of the $.getJSON callback? What about returning the variable, or setting a global?I'd appreciate any help. This just doesn't seem right...UPDATE:Tried setting the $.ajax() async setting to false, and running through the same code, with no luck. Code I tried is below:var jsonIssues = {};  // declare json variable$.ajax({ async: false });$.getJSON(""url"", function(data) {    jsonIssues = data.Issues;});// jsonIssues still not accessible hereAlso, I've had a couple responses that a global variable should work fine. I should clarify that all of this code is within $(document).ready(function() {. To set a global variable, should I just declare it before the document.ready? As such:var jsonIssues = {};$(document).ready(function() {  var jsonIssues = {};  // declare json variable  $.getJSON(""url"", function(data) {      jsonIssues = data.Issues;  });  // now accessible?}I was under the impression that that a variable declared within document.ready should be ""globally"" accessible and modifiable within any part of document.ready, including subfunctions like the $.getJSON callback function. I may need to read up on javascript variable scoping, but there doesn't seem to be an easy to achieve what I'm going for. Thanks for all the responses.UPDATE #2:Per comments given to answers below, I did use $.ajax instead of .getJSON, and achieved the results I wanted. Code is below:var jsonIssues = {};    $.ajax({        url: ""url"",        async: false,        dataType: 'json',        success: function(data) {            jsonIssues = data.Issues;        }    });    // jsonIssues accessible here -- good!!Couple follow-up comments to my answers (and I appreciate them all). My purpose in doing this is to load a JSON object initially with a list of Issues that the user can then remove from, and save off. But this is done via subsequent interactions on the page, and I cannot foresee what the user will want to do with the JSON object within the callback. Hence the need to make it accessible once the callback complete. Does anyone see a flaw in my logic here? Seriously, because there may be something I'm not seeing...Also, I was reading through the .ajax() jQuery documentation, and it says that setting async to false ""Loads data synchronously. Blocks the browser while the requests is active. It is better to block user interaction by other means when synchronization is necessary.""Does anyone have an idea how I should be blocking user interaction while this is going on? Why is it such a concern? Thanks again for all the responses.",javascript
12108,"Proper structuring of Lucene.Net usage in an ASP.NET MVC site I'm building an ASP.NET MVC site where I plan to use Lucene.Net. I've envisioned a way to structure the usage of Lucene, but not sure whether my planned architecture is OK and efficient.My Plan:On Application_Start event in Global.asax: I check for the existence of the index on the file system - if it doesn't exist, I create it and fill it with documents extracted it from the database.When new content is submitted: I create an IndexWriter, fill up a document, write to the index, and finally dispose of the IndexWriter. IndexWriters are not reused, as I can't imagine a good way to do that in an ASP.NET MVC application.When content is edited: I repeat the same process as when new content is submitted, except that I first delete the old content and then add the edits.When a user searches for content: I check HttpRuntime.Cache to see if a user has already searched for this term in the last 5 minutes - if they have, I return those results; otherwise, I create an IndexReader, build and run a query, put the results in HttpRuntime.Cache, return them to the user, and finally dispose of the IndexReader. Once again, IndexReaders aren't reused.My Questions:Is that a good structure - how can I improve it?Are there any performance/efficiency problems I should be aware of?Also, is not reusing the IndexReaders and IndexWriters a huge code smell?","c#,asp.net"

I think a lot of people have run into this same issue.  Here's a screenshot of what I'm seeing:Requirements:The new view must appear ""modally"", i.e. I need presentViewController.Display some sort of nav bar or toolbar, with the status bar taking on the background color of the nav bar ala iOS 7 style.It must work on iOS 6.I'm using a xib to handle layout, with autolayout enabled.Options:A. Shift your view's frame down by a bit.Ugh, are we back to the pre-iOS 5 days and mucking with frames?  Also it's generally not a good idea mixing with autolayout.B. Add a little gap up top below your nav bar.One disadvantage of options A and B is the status bar won't blend into your nav:C. Programatically add constraints.The main disadvantage is you'll have to muck with constraints and calculating the nav and status bar heights.  Yuck.D. Stretch the navigation bar / toolbar's height to include the area of the status bar.Looks good on iOS 7, but breaks on iOS 6.  You'll need to programatically update the height of the nav bar, and also make sure the rest of your view updates appropriately.  Messy.E. Mess with iOS6/7 deltas in IB.Multiple disadvantages: You'll be hardcoding the ios6/7 deltas.  Also doesn't work with autolayout.F.

4142,"How to solve limitations of SignalR in scaleout for backplane I use ASP.NET MVC and C# .I found SignalR for transfer data in real time,but signalR have some limits.according to the issue for this :Using a backplane, the maximum message throughput is lower than it is when clients talk directly to a single server node. That's because the backplane forwards every message to every node, so the backplane can become a bottleneck. Whether this limitation is a problem depends on the application. For example, here are some typical SignalR scenarios:Server broadcast (e.g., stock ticker): Backplanes work well for thisscenario, because the server controls the rate at which messages aresent.Client-to-client (e.g., chat): In this scenario, the backplane mightbe a bottleneck if the number of messages scales with the number ofclients; that is, if the rate of messages grows proportionally asmore clients join.High-frequency realtime (e.g., real-time games): A backplane is notrecommended for this scenario.My project needs to High-frequency realtime (e.g., real-time games) .Also I need real time video chatMy scenario :I have a Master server and multi Slave servers, Clients connect to the Slave servers and ans Slave servers connect to Master server.Example :Server Slave-1 and server Slave-2 connected to Master server, client-A and client-B connected to Slave-1 an client-C and  client-D connected to Slave-2,client-A send message or data or in live chat with client-DHow I can implement this scenario ?[Update-1]If i don't use signalR for that problem, So what should I use?[Update-2]In my scenario, the master server acts like a router and Slave server acts like a switch .

43779,"How to create a readable stream with an async data source in NodeJs? Environment:NodeJS, Express, DynamoDB (but could be any database really)Scenario:Need to read a large number of records and return to the user as a downloadable file. This means that I cannot buffer all the content at once and then send it in a response from Express. Also, I may need to execute the query multiple times since all data might not be returned in one query.Proposed Solution:Use a readable stream that can be piped to the response stream in Express.I started by creating an object that inherits from stream.Readable and implemented a _read() method which pushes the query results. The problem is that the database query invoked in _read() is async but the stream.read() is a sync method. When the stream is piped to the response of the server, the read is invoked several times before the db query even got a chance to execute. So the query is invoked multiple times and even when the first instance of the query finishes and does a push(null), the other queries complete and I get a ""push() after EOF"" error.Is there a way to do this properly with _read()?Should I forget about _read() and just execute the query and push() results in the constructor?Should I execute the query and emit data events instead of push()?Thank youfunction DynamoDbResultStream(query, options){    if(!(this instanceof DynamoDbResultStream)){        return new DynamoDbResultStream(query, options);    }    Readable.call(this, options);    this.dbQuery = query;    this.done = false;}util.inherits(DynamoDbResultStream, Readable);DynamoDbResultStream.prototype._read = function(){    var self = this;    if(!this.done){        dynamoDB.query(this.dbQuery, function(err, data) {            if (!err) {                try{                    for(i=0;i&lt;data.Items.length;i++){                        self.push(data.Items[i]);                    }                }catch(err){                    console.log(err);                }                if (data.LastEvaluatedKey) {                    //Next read() should invoke the query with a new start key                    self.dbQuery.ExclusiveStartKey = data.LastEvaluatedKey;                }else{                    self.done=true;                    self.push(null);                }            }else{                 console.log(err);                 self.emit('error',err);            }        });    }else{        self.push(null);    }};EDIT:After posting this question, I've found this post with an answer that shows how to do it without using inheritance: How to call an asynchronous function inside a node.js readable streamA comment was made there that inside _read() there should only be one push().

14686,"How am I supposed to pass data from serverside controller an AngularJS controller? I've encountered what I believe to be a common scenario, in which I am using an MVC pattern (specifically ASP.NET's MVC framework) for a web application, with AngularJS on the front-end. My problem is that I have a particular value which is part of the model getting passed to my view, which I also want to make available to my Angular controller's $scope, ideally as soon as the controller is initialized.How to do this is a question that has been asked and answered before. There's an obvious candidate for it: ngInit. However, at some point Angular updated their documentation with what appears to be a warning against this specific thought:  The only appropriate use of ngInit is for aliasing special properties of ngRepeat, as seen in the demo below. Besides this case, you should use controllers rather than ngInit to initialize values on a scope. The suggested alternative isn't very relevant.Of course, there are other workarounds I can think of. The view could insert the value into an ngModel directive on a hidden input, for example. Or I could just plain ignore the warning and use ngInit anyway. But any that I can think of are either an uglier way of doing the same thing as ngInit, or clearly worse.Ultimately the fact that what seems like the obvious solution to me is apparently the wrong one is probably an indicator that my mindset isn't in tune with how Angular is supposed to be done. So my question isn't ""how do I deal with this scenario"", instead it's:How am I supposed to deal with, or avoid, this scenario?Why am I not supposed to use ngInit?A clarification, since from the first two comments this isn't clear: This is for a situation where some or most of the page is being served directly as the MVC view, with only some particular piece of functionality being provided by Angular. The data that I want to pass to my Angular controller is already passed to the view in the model. I don't want the Angular controller to then go and have to do its own get request to the server just to get the same parameter that's already available to the view in a different format. ",javascript

36283,"How to use bootstrap modal to edit the table data in MVC? I have a table in MVC view that displays employee details. I'd like to add an edit functionality, but instead of opening it in a new page, I'd like to show it using a bootstrap modal.

18282,"How can I use the same regular expression in different programming languages? I've seen this question, and I know from experience that every language seems to support a different dialect of regex.  I figure the problem has been around for a long time, so somebody must have wanted to do something about it.I have a pretty big project that involves JavaScript, Ruby, and Java, and all of them have to touch the same regular expressions.  We picked Java as our ""official"" RE interpreter, which means that any time the other two languages need to evaluate an RE, they have to somehow pass it to a Java program, and that's starting to add up to a lot of overhead.If I could pick any RE dialect and invoke that at least semi-natively from all the languages, it'd be a huge step forward for us.  Is this possible?  Is it being done already?  We looked at PCRE, and it's technically possible to invoke it via native bindings from Java and Ruby (though it leaves JS out in the cold), but I haven't found anybody actually doing it.  Are we alone?ETA: a wrinkle I did not mention is that this system applies user supplied regex.  (Yes, I understand that this is a security issue, etc, but it's for  in-house use by trusted, attributed users.)  I can certainly suggest putting up a list of ""don't do this"" power-features to avoid, but I kind of hope it's not the best solution.",javascript

Most obvious is to build in this functionality into each view controller that may need to request this information, but I want to avoid this as much as possible because it makes controllers less generic, also makes testing harder.

UIView else {        return    }    statusBar.backgroundColor = color}I'm also showing the instruments tool to show more details on the leak:And I'm sure it's the FIRApp.configure() because I removed it for testing and there were no leaks.Hope anyone has an idea on how to fix this leak, thank you.",ios

10732,"How to handle javascript & css files across a site? I have had some thoughts recently on how to handle shared javascript and css files across a web application.In a current web application that I am working on, I got quite a large number of different javascripts and css files that are placed in an folder on the server. Some of the files are reused, while others are not.In a production site, it's quite stupid to have a high number of HTTP requests and many kilobytes of unnecessary javascript and redundant css being loaded. The solution to that is of course to create one big bundled file per page that only contains the necessary information, which then is minimized and sent compressed (GZIP) to the client.There's no worries to create a bundle of javascript files and minimize them manually if you were going to do it once, but since the app is continuously maintained and things do change and develop, it quite soon becomes a headache to do this manually while pushing out new updates that features changes to javascripts and/or css files to production.What's a good approach to handle this? How do you handle this in your application?",javascript

28701,"What's the point of returning an ""Undefined Value"" when re-defining ""print()"" function for QScriptEngine? [Background]The default print() function of QScriptEngine prints the result to the terminal of Qt Creator IDE for debugging purpose. As a result, the output must be redirected to our texteditor if we are going to make a ECMA script interpreter ourselves.This part of the document ""Making Applications Scriptable"" remains untouched since Qt 4.3.Section ""Redefining print()"":  Qt Script provides a built-in print() function that can be useful for  simple debugging purposes. The built-in print() function writes to  standard output. You can redefine the print() function (or add your  own function, e.g. debug() or log()) that redirects the text to  somewhere else. The following code shows a custom print() that adds  text to a QPlainTextEdit.So here is the suggested re-definition of print():QScriptValue QtPrintFunction(QScriptContext *context, QScriptEngine *engine) {     QString result;     for (int i = 0; i &lt; context-&gt;argumentCount(); ++i) {         if (i &gt; 0)             result.append("" "");         result.append(context-&gt;argument(i).toString());     }     QScriptValue calleeData = context-&gt;callee().data();     QPlainTextEdit *edit = qobject_cast&lt;QPlainTextEdit*&gt;(calleeData.toQObject());     edit-&gt;appendPlainText(result);     return engine-&gt;undefinedValue(); }At first, I doubted the need of returning an ""Undefined Value"" by return engine-&gt;undefinedValue();, and it looks like the role of the argument *engine is just to return this void value.So here is what I've done to change the function:QScriptValue myPrintFunction(QScriptContext *context, QScriptEngine *engine){    QString result;    for (int i = 0; i &lt; context-&gt;argumentCount(); ++i) {        if (i &gt; 0)            result.append("" "");        result.append(context-&gt;argument(i).toString());    }    /*    QScriptValue calleeData = context-&gt;callee().data();    QPlainTextEdit *edit = qobject_cast&lt;QPlainTextEdit*&gt;(calleeData.toQObject());    edit-&gt;appendPlainText(result);    return engine-&gt;undefinedValue();    */    return engine-&gt;toScriptValue(result); // ---&gt; return the result directly}which I think is more reasonable to me: returning an evaluated QScriptValue from script engine, and the value can later be translated to QString for output. This bypass the need of dynamic type cast, which could become messy especially for customized QObjects. For both kinds of print function, here is the exposition to the script engine: QScriptEngine *engine = new QScriptEngine(this);  QTextEdit *input = new QTextEdit(this); QTextEdit *output = new QTextEdit(this); // Use documented print function :  QScriptValue fun = engine-&gt;newFunction(QtPrintFunction); // Use my revised print function :  // QScriptValue fun = engine-&gt;newFunction(myPrintFunction); fun.setData(engine-&gt;newQObject(output)); engine-&gt;globalObject().setProperty(""print"", fun);Evaluation and output:QString command = input-&gt;toPlainText();QScriptValue result = engine-&gt;evaluate(command);output-&gt;append(result.toString());[Compilable Code](Qt version > 4 is needed)test.proQT += core gui widgets scriptTARGET = TestTEMPLATE = appSOURCES += main.cpp\        console.cppHEADERS  += console.hmain.cpp#include &lt;QApplication&gt;#include ""console.h""int main(int argc, char *argv[]){    QApplication app(argc, argv);    Console w;    w.show();    return app.exec();}console.h#ifndef CONSOLE_H#define CONSOLE_H#include &lt;QWidget&gt;#include &lt;QVBoxLayout&gt;#include &lt;QTextEdit&gt;#include &lt;QPushButton&gt;#include &lt;QScriptEngine&gt;class Console : public QWidget{    Q_OBJECTpublic:    Console();    ~Console();public slots:    void runScript();private:    QScriptEngine *engine;    QVBoxLayout *layout;    QPushButton *run;    QTextEdit *input, *output;};QScriptValue QtPrintFunction(QScriptContext *context, QScriptEngine *engine);QScriptValue myPrintFunction(QScriptContext *context, QScriptEngine *engine);#endif // CONSOLE_Hconsole.cpp#include ""console.h""Console::Console(){    engine = new QScriptEngine(this);    layout = new QVBoxLayout(this);    run = new QPushButton(""Run"",this);    input = new QTextEdit(this);    output = new QTextEdit(this);    layout-&gt;addWidget(input);    layout-&gt;addWidget(run);    layout-&gt;addWidget(output);    //QScriptValue fun = engine-&gt;newFunction(QtPrintFunction);    QScriptValue fun = engine-&gt;newFunction(myPrintFunction);    fun.setData(engine-&gt;newQObject(output));    engine-&gt;globalObject().setProperty(""print"", fun);    connect(run, SIGNAL(clicked()), this, SLOT(runScript()));}void Console::runScript(){    QString command = input-&gt;toPlainText();    QScriptValue result = engine-&gt;evaluate(command);    output-&gt;append(result.toString());}QScriptValue QtPrintFunction(QScriptContext *context, QScriptEngine *engine){    QString result;    for (int i = 0; i &lt; context-&gt;argumentCount(); ++i) {        if (i &gt; 0)            result.append("" "");        result.append(context-&gt;argument(i).toString());    }    QScriptValue calleeData = context-&gt;callee().data();    QTextEdit *edit = qobject_cast&lt;QTextEdit*&gt;(calleeData.toQObject());    edit-&gt;append(result);    return engine-&gt;undefinedValue();}QScriptValue myPrintFunction(QScriptContext *context, QScriptEngine *engine){    QString result;    for (int i = 0; i &lt; context-&gt;argumentCount(); ++i) {        if (i &gt; 0)            result.append("" "");        result.append(context-&gt;argument(i).toString());    }    return engine-&gt;toScriptValue(result);}Console::~Console(){}[Example]Input 1:print(123);Output (Qt Document QtPrintFunction()):123undefinedOutput (My version myPrintFunction()):123Input 2:for (i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)    print(i);Output (Qt Document QtPrintFunction() ):  0    1    2    undefinedOutput (myPrintFunction()):  2Input 3:print(""Stack"");print(""Overflow"");Output (Qt Document QtPrintFunction() ):  Stack    Overflow    undefinedOutput (My version myPrintFunction()):  Overflow[Question]Although myPrintFunction seems to work fine at first, it didn't work when there are more than two print called in a script, where only the last print will be executed.

Seems simple enough:&lt;meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=640, maximum-scale=1.0"" /&gt;This works as expected in iPad/iPhone. However, on an Android tablet (ex. in landscape mode), the content gets scaled up to fit the display. In other words, Android is simply ignoring maximum-scale=1 .

If I set width=device-width, the page will not automatically be scaled down to fit the phone..Thanks much.",ios
36042,"How to set up IIS 7 application pool identity correctly? Having deployed my website to IIS7.5 I found one strange behaviour: when application pool identity is left to be ApplicationPoolIdentity by default (as recommended in IIS Application Pool Identities), Ninject seems to be ignored, as I get the following error, while creating the very first controller:  System.InvalidOperationException: An error occurred when trying to  create a controller of type  '..MainController'. Make sure  that the controller has a parameterless public constructor. --->  System.DirectoryServices.DirectoryServicesCOMException: An operations  error occurred.I tried to grant FullAccess to IIS AppPool\&lt;MySiteAppPool&gt; to the folder, containing the site (including all subfolders and files), but this did not change anything.However, when I set the application pool identity to any domain account (even a simple one, without administrative privilages, as well as without any access to the folder with the site), it works normally.Ninject is installed according to Setting up an MVC3 application tutorial through the NuGet package.I am not sure, if it's relevant, the site is supposed to work in a domain intranet with windows authentication.So, the only problem seems to be with the application pool identity. As far as I am eager to use the recommended way, I'd love to have the ApplicationPoolIdentity, not a domain account.What can this be connected with? Is it possible to mix all these together?Here is an SO thread with a similar issue: ASP.NET MVC 4 + Ninject MVC 3 = No parameterless constructor defined for this object. However no suitable answer there at all either.As a deleted comment suggested, I tried using NetworkSerive as the identity. And it worked properly. However, I guess this is not much better, than a non-privileged domain account.EDITSuddenly found another dependency: the application pool identity is used for the windows authentication on sql server, though I expected the client-side user's credentials to be used there.Based on commentsAgree that a remote sql server can be accessed with the authenticated credentials via impersonation.However it is still not clear what the problem is with ApplicationPoolIdentity and Ninject.The article mentiond at the very top of this question made me suppose that this could be caused by the fact, that virtual account has no user profile. This aspect remains unclear to me, as one can still enable IIS to load the user profile with the LoadUserProfile attribute. I can't get, what is IIS going to load, if there is no profile for the virtual account?It is said there:  IIS doesn't load the Windows user profile, but certain applications  might take advantage of it anyway to store temporary data. SQL Express  is an example of an application that does this. However, a user  profile has to be created to store temporary data in either the  profile directory or in the registry hive. The user profile for the  NETWORKSERVICE account was created by the system and was always  available. However, with the switch to unique Application Pool  identities, no user profile is created by the system. Only the  standard Application Pools (DefaultAppPool and Classic .NET AppPool)  have user profiles on disk. No user profile is created if the  Administrator creates a new Application Pool.    However, if you want, you can configure IIS Application Pools to load  the user profile by setting the ""LoadUserProfile"" attribute to ""true"".I found the following thread on serverfault.com:How can I assign active directory permission to the default app pool identityThere it is also stated that app pool identity is unable to work as a network service, in particular, query the AD.","c#,asp.net"

20701,"importing AppDelegate Often times I initialize my model class variables in my AppDelegate so they can be used by different ViewControllers without passing their instance across class files.

I currently use this line of code to get my appDelegate instance:id appDelegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate];Conceptually, I want to know if this is the accepted way to interact with an application's model classes.

This works GREAT, everything was being read correctly, we almost thought this solved everything. Except this causes double requests from the client to our server.Is there any way to make NVDA read the contents of an angular state like a regular page load, without having to force the reload of the page?Please dont say use aria-roles only or something like that that doesnt work for this and we already have them, we need the application to read everything when changing states.ANY help is appreciated, we are about to give up, and restart the project without angular as we are not able to achieve our accessibility requirement.",javascript

I used this tutorial as a guide and did succeed in having the webview display my webapp. So now I want to debug the javascript code.I know the webapp works, since I've tried it in both an android webview as well as countless browsers (including safari on the iPad simulator I'm using).

Sadly This doesn't seem to work with the new WKWebView.When I navigate to Develop-&gt;iPad Simulator I'm told that there are 'No Inspectable Applications'. I've tried the very same thing with a simple app with a UIWebView and debugging through safari works perfectly there.Is there a way to debug javascript code within a WKWebView?To reproduce my problems (using swift), start a new single screen project in xCode 6, copy the code (courtesy of kinderas) provided below in your ViewController.swift file and drag the outlet to View under View Controller in the document outline in the Main.storyboard file.

48755,"Node streams cause large memory footprint or leak I'm using node v0.12.7 and want to stream directly from a database to the client (for file download). However, I am noticing a large memory footprint (and possible memory leak) when using streams.With express, I create an endpoint that simply pipes a readable stream to the response as follows:app.post('/query/stream', function(req, res) {  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/octet-stream');  res.setHeader('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename=""blah.txt""');  //...retrieve stream from somewhere...  // stream is a readable stream in object mode  stream    .pipe(json_to_csv_transform_stream) // I've removed this and see the same behavior    .pipe(res);});In production, the readable stream retrieves data from a database. The amount of data is quite large (1M+ rows). I swapped out this readable stream with a dummy stream (see code below) to simplify debugging and am noticing the same behavior: my memory usage jumps up by ~200M each time. Sometimes the garbage collection will kick in and the memory drops down a bit, but it linearly rises until my server runs out of memory.The reason I started using streams was to not have to load large amounts of data into memory. Is this behavior expected?I also notice that, while streaming, my CPU usage jumps to 100% and blocks (which means other requests can't be processed).Am I using this incorrectly?Dummy readable stream code// Setup a custom readablevar Readable = require('stream').Readable;function Counter(opt) {  Readable.call(this, opt);  this._max = 1000000; // Maximum number of records to generate  this._index = 1;}require('util').inherits(Counter, Readable);// Override internal read// Send dummy objects until max is reachedCounter.prototype._read = function() {  var i = this._index++;  if (i &gt; this._max) {    this.push(null);  }  else {    this.push({      foo: i,      bar: i * 10,      hey: 'dfjasiooas' + i,      dude: 'd9h9adn-09asd-09nas-0da' + i    });  }};// Create the readable streamvar counter = new Counter({objectMode: true});//...return it to calling endpoint handler...UpdateJust a small update, I never found the cause. My initial solution was to use cluster to spawn off new processes so that other requests could still be handled.I've since updated to node v4. While cpu/mem usage is still high during processing, it seems to have fixed the leak (meaning mem usage goes back down).",javascript
30059,"Why (and how) ASP.NET Cache gets stored in Unmanaged Memory? OK, all you ASP.NET Experts: I have used reflector to look into ASP.NET Cache implementation (which sits on HttpRuntime.Cache and HttpContext.Current.Cache) uses a Hashtable internally to keep the cache.However, the data gets stored in unmanaged memory. This is very strange since I could not see anywhere data getting stored in unmanaged memory. However, writing a very simple web application that inserts a chunk of byte array into cache, we can see this:Private Bytes: 460MBBytes in all heaps: 150MB =>Managed Memory: 150 MBUnmanaged Memory: 310 MBSo basically I am calling the application many times (each increase is 1000x requests each putting 64KB empty buffer byte[] into cache). So the one that has grown the most is private bytes (total memory) instead of bytes in all heaps (managed memory). However I am expecting managed memory to grow in line with total memory since I am adding objects to the managed heap using Hashtable.Can you please explain this behaviour?UPDATEAs Simon said, the bytes in all heaps value only changes after a garbage collection - I changed the code to induce garbage collection and it update the counters. Increase in Gen 2 Heap memory is EXACTLY the same as the amount of memory added. However, unmanaged memory is still much higher. In this example, Heap 2 was only 96MB while total memory 231 MB.",asp.net
20564,"Web Application Structure and Deployment Our product is an ASP.Net web application.  Currently, we use Web Site Projects in Visual Studio, but have been looking into using Web Application Projects for quite some time.  I am currently researching them so that we can hopefully improve our deployment process.We have a base web site that is shared and common between different clients, and then we extend that with client-specific functionality in client Web Site Projects.  The client projects extend base, and therefore rely on its contents.  To build the full product, we first deploy the base web site, and then overlay it with the content from the client project.In looking at converting to Web Application Projects in Visual Studio, we were hoping to be able to create the base project, then create client projects and set up references to base.  This structure seems to work OK, but when we are attempting to deploy the application from the client project using MSDeploy, only the dll from the base web site is being published.  This is fine for some things, referencing the compiled code is useful, but there are other items like images, js pages, htm, etc that is still source that is required for the client application to function.  We need more than the compiled code from our base web site.That all being said, I can think of a few options here:Continue to deploy in 2 steps.  First the base web site, then the client web site to build the full product.Modify the deployment process to copy the required source files from the base projectRe-architect our model to support this base-client relationship in a different manner.  Not quite sure how this would work, and would be the least-viable option.??Is there a different option that I am missing?  Am I doing something wrong with the way I am setting up my projects?  Is there more to making a Web Application reference another Web Application beyond sharing compiled code?  If that's the case, why wouldn't you just use a shared class library?  Or maybe I am missing something with the MS Deploy process?I am open to suggestions here as I feel like I am missing something. I don't think our model for our web applications is too unique.  Update: The dual-deploy process does work, but feels a little kludgey.  Any other input?",asp.net
42910,"Audio from Icecast server not playing in Chrome I'm having trouble getting static content (mp3 files) served by an Icecast server to play in Google Chrome browser with HTML5. The reason we're serving the mp3s via Icecast is policy: the CPB requires they be ""streamed"" and not ""downloaded"" since we're public radio. Our live audio streams play just fine in Chrome. If you put the URL for an MP3 served by my Icecast 2.4.3 server straight into the URL bar in google Chrome, it does not play. Do the same thing in Firefox, IE, Safari, etc.. it plays! Try it: https://streaming.kansaspublicradio.org:8001/mp3/First_0713886.mp3 (The temporary solution I'm using is Flash but the latest update to Chrome (v60.0) makes Flash blocked by default, the ""Always allow for this website"" option does not seem to be working, and the little icon showing that Flash is blocked is much more discrete. Try it here: http://kansaspublicradio.org/kpr-news/midwest-farmers-hope-boost-online-grocery-shopping )My best guess as to why this is happening is that it has something to do with this: https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/play-returns-promise?hl=enSo I tried to reproduce their code example, in which they monkey with HTML5 Media Capture to get audio to play without user interaction. But with this URL for the audio, it fails to play and throws this error: Uncaught (in promise) DOMException: The element has no supported sources. Try it: https://jsfiddle.net/wo94xohr/2/ It only fails in Chrome and not Firefox or others.I tried again but without the HTML5 Media Capture stuff. Still no dice. Try it: https://jsfiddle.net/yrhets74/Also, if you look at the response headers, you see ""Content-Range:bytes 0-0/0""... could this mean something?

This works, but how do I set a correct animation duration for the moving of the UIView based on the view's current location and velocity of the pan so that it seems smooth?

Also, class used in earlier versions, for representation of a background download task, is still NOT deprecated in iOS 13 and is the only result when searched for background download on iOS 13. Similarly, background configuration used for the HTTP session, is still NOT deprecated. So, I believe the current background download implementation is the one recommended by Apple.(As per my understanding, ""BGTaskScheduler"" is not intended for this, please correct me if wrong).So, is this due to any newly introduced bug in iOS 13?OR any change in this implementation, specific to iOS 13, is expected by Apple?Edit:I have already added the handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession callback. Found that the respective logs are not printed and app size does not increase in Settings on iOS 13. So, it appears that download does not continue in the background and it is not related to download related callbacks not getting invoked.",ios

3344,"Firing javascript event on every DOM change ""complete"" I know this could be handled in some way, but as of now, this is giving me a real hard time. I am writing a script and want to fire some particular functions when a DOM manipulation is complete. I cannot modify/add/remove any other script (as it might be injected into the page using some framework). The page is using ajax requests(not implemented in jQuery) to load/modify content. Now I want an event to be triggered when every DOM modification has been completed. My current approach is to fire the function at every DOMSubtreeModified event. Something like this$(document).bind('DOMSubtreeModified', doSomeStuff);But the drawback of this approach is, let say the ajax loads 10 elements in a call, then for each element doSomeStuff is fired. Can this be limited to only firing after the 10th element is loaded? Something like resetting the $(document).ready() event? so $(document).ready() is fired every time the DOM is ready (after loading ajax content)",javascript

14901,"How to share intermediate results of continuations? Please note that even though the example in this question is encoded in Javascript, the underlying concepts are common in Haskell and I while I prefer to express myself in Javascript I also appreciate answers in Haskell.In Javascript I use CPS to handle asynchronous computations according to monadic principles. For the sake of simplicity, however, I will use the normal continuation monad for this question.As soon as my continuation compositions grow, I keep finding myself in a situation where I need access to intermediate results of these compositions. Since Javascript is imperative it is easy to store such results in variables and access them later. But since we're talking about continuations accessing intermediate results means calling functions and accessing them several times means a lot of re-evaluation.This seems to be well suited for memoization. But how can I memoize a function's return value if that very function doesn't return anything but merely calls its continuation (and btw. as I mentioned before I use asynchronous functions that also don't return anything in the current cycle of Javascript's event loop).It seems as if I have to extract the right continuation. Maybe this is possible with delimited continuations through shift/reset, but I don't know how to apply these combinators. This issue is probably not that hard to solve and I'm just confused by the magical land of continuation passing style...so please be indulgent with me.Here is a simplified example of Cont without memoization in Javascript:const taggedLog = tag =&gt; s =&gt;  (console.log(tag, s), s);const id = x =&gt; x;const Cont = k =&gt; ({  runCont: k,  [Symbol.toStringTag]: ""Cont""});const contAp = tf =&gt; tx =&gt;  Cont(k =&gt; tf.runCont(f =&gt; tx.runCont(x =&gt; k(f(x)))));const contLiftA2 = f =&gt; tx =&gt; ty =&gt;  contAp(contMap(f) (tx)) (ty);const contOf = x =&gt; Cont(k =&gt; k(x));const contMap = f =&gt; tx =&gt;  Cont(k =&gt; tx.runCont(x =&gt; k(f(x))));                                  const contReset = tx =&gt; // delimited continuations  contOf(tx.runCont(id));const contShift = f =&gt; // delimited continuations  Cont(k =&gt; f(k).runCont(id));const inc = contMap(x =&gt; taggedLog(""eval inc"") (x + 1));const inc2 = inc(contOf(2));const inc3 = inc(contOf(3));const add = contLiftA2(x =&gt; y =&gt; taggedLog(""eval add"") (x + y));const mul = contLiftA2(x =&gt; y =&gt; taggedLog(""eval mul"") (x * y));const intermediateResult = add(inc2) (inc3);mul(intermediateResult) (intermediateResult).runCont(id);/*  should only log four lines:  eval inc 3  eval inc 4  eval add 7  eval mul 49*/",javascript

18876,"ASP.NET MVC and IE caching - manipulating response headers ineffective BackgroundI'm attempting to help a colleague debug an issue that hasn't been an issue for the past 6 months. After the most recent deployment of an ASP.NET MVC 2 application, FileResult responses that force a PDF file at the user for opening or saving are having trouble existing long enough on the client machine for the PDF reader to open them.Earlier versions of IE (expecially 6) are the only browsers affected. Firefox and Chrome and newer versions of IE (>8) all behave as expected. With that in mind, the next section defines the actions necessary to recreate the issue.BehaviorUser clicks a link that points to an action method (a plain hyperlink with an href attribute).The action method generates a PDF represented as a byte stream. The method always recreates the PDF.In the action method, headers are set to instruct browsers how to cache the response. They are:response.AddHeader(""Cache-Control"", ""public, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"");response.AddHeader(""Pragma"", ""no-cache"");response.AddHeader(""Expires"", ""0"");For those unfamiliar with exactly what the headers do:a. Cache-Control: public  Indicates that the response MAY be cached by any cache, even if it would normally be non-cacheable or cacheable only within a non- shared cache.b. Cache-Control: must-revalidate  When the must-revalidate directive is present in a response received by a cache, that cache MUST NOT use the entry after it becomes stale to respond to a  subsequent request without first revalidating it with the origin serverc. Cache-Control: pre-check (introduced with IE5)  Defines an interval in seconds after which an entity must be checked for freshness. The check may happen after the user is shown the resource but ensures that on the next roundtrip the cached copy will be up-to-date.d. Cache-Control: post-check (introduced with IE5)  Defines an interval in seconds after which an entity must be checked for freshness prior to showing the user the resource.e. Pragma: no-cache (to ensure backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0)  When the no-cache directive is present in a request message, an application SHOULD forward the request toward the origin server even if it has a cached copy of what is being requestedf. Expires  The Expires entity-header field gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale.We return the file from the actionreturn File(file, ""mime/type"", fileName);The user is presented with an Open/Save dialog boxClicking ""Save"" works as expected, but clicking ""Open"" launches the PDF reader, but the temporary file IE stored has already been deleted by the time the reader tries to open the file, so it complains that the file is missing (and it is).There are a half dozen other apps here that use the same headers to force Excel, CSV, PDF, Word, and a ton of other content at users and there's never been an issue.The QuestionAre the headers correct for what we're trying to do? We want the file to exist temporarily (get cached), but always be replaced by new versions even though the requests may be identical).The response headers are set in the action method before return a FileResult. I've asked my colleague to try creating a new class that inherits from FileResult and to instead override the ExecuteResult method so that it modifies the headers and then does base.ExecuteResult() instead -- no status on that.I have a hunch the ""Expires"" header of ""0"" is the culprit. According to this W3C article, setting it to ""0"" implies ""already expired."" I do want it to be expired, I just don't want IE to go removing it off of the filesystem before the application handling it gets a chance to open it.As always, thanks!Edit: The SolutionUpon further testing (using Fiddler to inspect the headers), we were seeing that the response headers we thought were getting set were not the ones being interpreted by the browser. Having not been familiar with the code myself, I was unaware of an underlying issue: the headers were getting stomped on outside of the action method.Nonetheless, I'm going to leave this question open. Still outstanding is this: there seems to be some discrepancy between the Expires header having a value of 0 vs. -1. If anybody can lay claim to differences by design, in regards to IE, I would still like to hear about it. As for a solution though, the above headers do work as intended with the Expires value set to -1 in all browsers.Update 1The post How to control web page caching, across all browsers? describes in detail that caching can be prevented in all browsers with the help of setting Expires = 0. I'm still not sold on this 0 vs -1 argument...",asp.net

If we set the displayHeaderFooter parameter to true, then we can set specific page header and footer by using the parameters headerTemplate and footerTemplate. The protocol provides some HTML classes to display some information, these are: date, title, URL, pageNumber, and totalPages.For example, we can set footerTemplate to &lt;span class=&quot;pageNumber&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to display the current page number in the footer. We also need to add some style to display it properly. The default header and footer settings can be found here, and the renderer C++ component is here.I would like to modify the displayed pageNumber values. My goal is to count pages from a given number.The Puppeteer API documentation note that headerTemplate and footerTemplate markup have the following limitations:Script tags inside templates are not evaluated.Page styles are not visible inside templates.A GitHub comment provides the following:&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;div id=&quot;test&quot;&gt;header test&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;img src='http://www.chromium.org/_/rsrc/1438879449147/config/customLogo.gif?revision=3' onload='document.getElementById(&quot;test&quot;).style.color = &quot;green&quot;;this.parentNode.removeChild(this);'/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It says, if we use an onload attribute on an img tag, then we can run JavaScript in the templates. However, I was not able to reproduce the result, which is shown in the screenshot under the snippet.For example, the following JavaScript could count pages from 10:&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&quot; alt=&quot;tmpimg&quot; onload=&quot;var x = document.getElementById('pn').innerHTML; var y = 10; document.getElementById('pn').innerHTML = parseInt(x) + y; this.parentNode.removeChild(this);&quot;/&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;pn&quot; class=&quot;pageNumber&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;But unfortunately, this script does not modify the page numbering, and I have no idea how to solve this problem. I've also tried to use pure CSS solutions, but without success.Any ideas are welcome to resolve this issue.",javascript

For example, we are not clear how to ask the user for IP and password of SQL server.

19497,"Why Javascript is used in MongoDB or CouchDB instead of other languages such as Java, C++? My understanding of the Javascript so far has been that it is a client-side language that capture events and makes a web-page dynamic. But on reading the comparison between MongoDB, and CouchDB (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Comparing+Mongo+DB+and+Couch+DB ) I noticed that both are using JS. This makes me wonder the reason behind the choice of JS over other conventional languages. I guess I am trying to understand the role of JS and its advantages over other languages. Update: I am not asking about the languages/drivers supported by the two dbs. The comparison says--""Both CouchDB and MongoDB make use of Javascript.  CouchDB uses Javascript extensively including in the building of views ....MongoDB also supports running arbitrary javascript functions server-side and uses javascript for map/reduce operations.""My lack of understanding pertains to why is JS being used at all for the backend work. Why is it preferred for building views in CouchDB, or for using map/reduce operations? Why C/C++ or Java were not used? What are the advantages in using JS for such back-end work?Answer:To summarize answers on https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/q/121411/41398 . MongoDB and other NoSQL dbs are using SpiderMonkey to execute server-side JS functions.

8035,"Using javascript to reset the meta tag to prevent it from refreshing the page We have an legacy application (mixture of classic ASP and ASP.net) that has a few Ajax content rich pages.The expectation is that the users of the site performs a set of tasks on the page that can span a fair amount of time say, 15-30 minutes.One of the requirements is that users logging in to the site be automatically logged out after 15 mins of inactivity. This is currently being achieved by using the meta tags for redirecting the user to the logout page after 15 minutes of inactivity in the page.&lt;meta name='Refresh' http-equiv=""Refresh"" content=""900;URL=/someurl/logout.asp""&gt;The problem we're having is that the browser doesnt think there has been any activity on the page despite having many AJAX interactions with the server. So after the 15 minutes of what the browser thinks as inactivity, the user is logged out automatically even if they are in the middle of doing something.Inspired by this message board post we tried to fix the annoyance by using javascript(JQuery) like soThe below would be an event handler such as clicking of the save on the page etc. for simplicity here is the page load to modify the refresh time to 5 seconds$(document).ready(function() {    var selector = 'meta[name=Refresh]';    var content = $(selector).attr(""content""); //""900;URL=/someurl/logout.asp""    $(selector).attr(""content"", ""5;URL=/someurl/logout.asp""); });The intent being (re)setting the meta tag content the page refresh timer would be reset. Unfortunately this doesnt seem to work (in IE). Since this is a legacy application, some of the decisions i.e. to use meta tags etc. are baked in. The question is, is there a way to get meta tag refresh to peacefully co-exist with an Ajax application? Am I doing something wrong and is there a way to solve this problem? ",javascript

41766,"Scoped services in ASP.NET Core with SignalR Hubs I have introduced SignalR into my ASP.NET Core 2 project, but I'm having some issues using a scoped service that I normally use in my controllers. I feel like the problem may be due to the difference in lifecycles between HTTP requests, websockets and hubs.On each HTTP request, middleware reads the Authorization token and updates some properties (e.g. id, claims, etc.) on a scoped service (IUser) for the request. I use this service in all of my controllers with no issue. To get this to work with SignalR, I am sending an access_token query parameter and using some other middleware beforehand to add this query parameter as a header which works fine.The problem arises when I am trying to access the IUser service in my SignalR hub. On construction of the hub, the IUser that gets injected has none of the properties set, despite the middleware for the /hub request just setting them.If I set the service to be a singleton then it works, but IUser should never persist longer than a single request.How should I go about setting an IUser for a specific SignalR connection?// Startup.cs - User has several settable properties services.AddScoped&lt;IUser, User&gt;();// User Middlewarepublic class UserMiddleware{    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;    public UserMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)    {        _next = next;    }    public Task Invoke(HttpContext context)    {        // retrieve service for this request        var user = context.RequestServices.GetService&lt;IUser&gt;();        // set some properties on the User from auth token        // e.g. User.Id = 1;        return _next(context);    }}[Authorize(Roles = Claim.Names.Read)]public class MyHub : Hub{    private readonly IUser _user;    public MyHub(IUser user)    {        // user that gets injected has null properties        _user = user;    }    public async Task Foo()    {        // do work with the _user credentials    }}public class DownloadController : Controller{    private readonly IUser _user;    public DownloadController(IUser user)    {        // user gets injected and has properties set        _user = user;    }}","c#,asp.net"

5124,"Are named functions underrated in JavaScript? Taking the jQuery framework for example, if you run code like this:$(document).ready(function init() { foo.bar(); });The stack trace you get in Firebug will look like this:init()anonymous()anonymous([function(), init(), function(), 4 more...], function(), Object name=args)anonymous()anonymous()As you can see, it's not very readable, because you have to click on each function to find out what it is. The anonymous functions would also show up as (?)() in the profiler, and they can lead to the ""cannot access optimized closure"" bug. It seems to me that these are good reasons to avoid them. Then there's the fact that ECMAScript 5 will deprecate arguments.callee in its strict mode, which means it won't be possible to reference anonymous functions with it, making them a little less future-proof.On the other hand, using named functions can lead to repetition, e.g.:var Foo = {    bar: function bar() {}}function Foo() {}Foo.prototype.bar = function bar() {}Am I correct in thinking that this repetition is justified in light of the debugging convenience named functions provide, and that the prevalence of anonymous functions in good frameworks like jQuery is an oversight?",javascript

317,"How to log all possible console errors occurring in Angular application on a client's side? Currently, my Angular application consists of a significant number of submodules and components. Angular applications are quite sensitive to html rendering errors. For example, if we get a NULL object from an API and trying to get access to its property, it partially breaks rendering of the application. It is quite difficult to handle and test such cases taking into account that the application is constantly growing. Do you know if it is possible to create a script that can log all error appearing in a console? Here what I have got: 1) An http requests error handle to log broken requests from an API:  private handleError&lt;T&gt; (operation = 'operation', result?: T) {    return (error: any): Observable&lt;T&gt; =&gt; {      // TODO: send the error to remote logging infrastructure      console.error(error); // log to console instead      // TODO: better job of transforming error for user consumption      this.log(`${operation} failed: ${error.message}`);      // Let the app keep running by returning an empty result.      return of(result as T);    };  }2) Client-side logger but for whatever reason it only logs errors from crawlers :) &lt;script&gt;  window.onerror = function(m,u,l,c) {    if (window.XMLHttpRequest) {      var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();      var data = ""msg=""+encodeURIComponent(m)        +""&amp;url=""+encodeURIComponent(u)        +""&amp;line=""+l        +""&amp;col=""+c        +""&amp;href=""+encodeURIComponent(window.location.href);      xhr.open(""GET"", ""logger.php?""+data, true);      xhr.setRequestHeader(""Content-Type"", ""text/plain;charset=UTF-8"");      xhr.send();    }  };&lt;/script&gt;It would be very useful to get a script that can simply log all errors from console and ",javascript

530,"Can you Instantiate an Object Instance from JSON in .NET? Since Object Initializers are very similar to JSON, and now there are Anonymous Types in .NET. It would be cool to be able to take a string, such as JSON, and create an Anonymous Object that represents the JSON string.Use Object Initializers to create an Anonymous Type:var person = new {    FirstName = ""Chris"",    LastName = ""Johnson""};It would be awesome if you could pass in a string representation of the Object Initializer code (preferably something like JSON) to create an instance of an Anonymous Type with that data.I don't know if it's possible, since C# isn't dynamic, and the compiler actually converts the Object Initializer and Anonymous Type into strongly typed code that can run. This is explained in this article.Maybe functionality to take JSON and create a key/value Dictionary with it would work best.I know you can serialize/deserializer an object to JSON in .NET, but what I'm look for is a way to create an object that is essentially loosely typed, similarly to how JavaScript works.Does anyone know the best solution for doing this in .NET?UPDATE: Too clarify the context of why I'm asking this... I was thinking of how C# could better support JSON at the language level (possibly) and I was trying to think of ways that it could be done today, for conceptual reasons.

32910,"Access App.Config Settings from Class Library Called through Unit Test Project I have the following setup:ASP.net 3.5 Web Site ProjectC# Class Library with business logicC# Class Library for unit testingThe business logic library does all of the db access. It gets connection strings from the web.config file of the web site by accessing System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings. When the library is called by the web site, this works fine, as the library looks for the config of the caller.I want to be able to test my business logic through the unit testing class library. I have put an App.config file in the root of the testing class library. From what I read, when the testing library calls data access procedures that are part of the business logic library, the connection settings from the App.config file of the testing library should be accessed and used. However, when I try to run my unit tests, I am getting errors back that indicate that the testing library's App.config file (and/or its contents) is not being accessed successfully.My retrieval of the config properties (from within the business logic library) looks like this:public SqlConnection MainConnection {  get {    string conn = """";    try {      conn = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[""connString""].ConnectionString;    } catch {      // might be calling from test project. Need to reference app settings      conn = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""connString""];    }    return new SqlConnection(conn);  }}When this is called from the website project, it works. From within the unit test, the conn variable is never set to anything (I have also tried System.Configuration.ConfigurationSettings.AppSettings, and using  instead of  with the same result). What do I need to do to make the business logic class library successfully retrieve the unit test class libraries settings, when called from within the NUnit GUI?","c#,asp.net"
46314,"How to get a screen reader to stop reading and read different content I've written a site that uses jQuery to display a modal popup. It essentially covers the entire viewable area of the screen with an overlay, then shows a DIV that contains the actual popup on top of the overlay. One of the requirements for this project has to do with accessibility.When the page loads, the screen reader starts reading from the top of the page. When a user clicks on a particular link, we display a modal dialog. My question is: how do I interrupt the screen reader's reading of the main portion of the site and tell it to start reading the dialog text?My modal container is wrapped in a div like this:&lt;div id=""modalcontainer""  tabindex=""0"" class=""popup"" role=""dialog"" aria-labelledby=""dialog-label"" &gt;The jQuery that fires the modal looks like this:$(""#modalLink"").click(function (e) {    e.preventDefault();    $(""#modalcontainer"").center();    $(""#modalcontainer"").show();    $(""#closeBtnLink"").focus();    $(""#wrapper"").attr('aria-disabled', 'true');});The ""closeBtnLink"" is the close button within the modal dialog. I would have thought setting the focus on this would instruct the screen reader to start reading from that element.The ""wrapper"" element is a SIBLING of the modal dialog. Per a suggestion from another SO user for different reasons, I set ""aria-disabled=true"" on the wrapper element that contains the entire page. The modal dialog exists as a sibling outside of this container.My main goal here is to get the screen reader to read the contents of my modal DIV element when they click on a specific link. Any help would be appreciated.",javascript
49449,"How to get the real RGBA or ARGB color values without premultiplied alpha? I'm creating an bitmap context using CGBitmapContextCreate with the kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedFirst option.I made a 5 x 5 test image with some major colors (pure red, green, blue, white, black), some mixed colors (i.e. purple) combined with some alpha variations. Every time when the alpha component is not 255, the color value is wrong.I found that I could re-calculate the color when I do something like:almostCorrectRed = wrongRed * (255 / alphaValue);almostCorrectGreen = wrongGreen * (255 / alphaValue);almostCorrectBlue = wrongBlue * (255 / alphaValue);But the problem is, that my calculations are sometimes off by 3 or even more. So for example I get a value of 242 instead of 245 for green, and I am 100% sure that it must be exactly 245. Alpha is 128.Then, for the exact same color just with different alpha opacity in the PNG bitmap, I get alpha = 255 and green = 245 as it should be.If alpha is 0, then red, green and blue are also 0. Here all data is lost and I can't figure out the color of the pixel.How can I avoid or undo this alpha premultiplication alltogether so that I can modify pixels in my image based on the true R G B pixel values as they were when the image was created in Photoshop? How can I recover the original values for R, G, B and A?Background info (probably not necessary for this question):What I'm doing is this: I take a UIImage, draw it to a bitmap context in order to perform some simple image manipulation algorithms on it, shifting the color of each pixel depending on what color it was before. Nothing really special. But my code needs the real colors. When a pixel is transparent (meaning it has alpha less than 255) my algorithm shouldn't care about this, it should just modify R,G,B as needed while Alpha remains at whatever it is. Sometimes though it will shift alpha up or down too. But I see them as two separate things. Alpha contorls transparency, while R G B control the color.",ios

25651,"MVC4 Beta Minification and Bundling: Ordering files and debugging in browser I've started using bundling and minification included with the MVC4 Beta.

33533,"Webpack and imports-loader error ""Can't resolve"" I'm trying to use Webpack (v3.6.0) to bundle a lot of js files for my web application, some are angular components, but mostly they are legacy code.The legacy code is heavily interdependent of some specific functions. For instance, we have a specific file that declares 3 functions (PrepareTranslation, PrepareLocalTranslation and Translate), that are used throughout the system.I was looking for a way to make this 3 functions global, but instead, I found an article about 'imports-loader' that would allow me to inject variables into that code using a specific notation:require(""imports-loader?$=jquery!./myjs"");The above code would, inside myjs.js makevar $ = require('jquery');However, when I try using this method to inject requires and variables into my classes, Webpack throws an error ""Can't resolve imports-loader?$=jquery!./myjs"".Removing the ! from the string fixes the error, but I don't quite like the sintax that way, and it differs from everything I was able to find online so far.My entrypoint script for webpack is as follows:window._SYS_VER = '452';import 'jquery';import 'ThirdParty/angular/angular';import Emitter from 'ThirdParty/emitter';//SimpleMVC relatedimport 'imports-loader?jQuery=jquery./js/simplemvc/simplemvc.modaldialog';import 'imports-loader?jQuery=jquery./js/simplemvc/simplemvc.paneldialog';//     import 'imports-loader?jQuery=jquery!./js/simplemvc/simplemvc.paneldialog';import Translation from 'JS/simplemvc/simplemvc.i18n';// jQuery relatedimport 'JS/jquery/ui/jquery-ui.min';import 'JS/jquery/masked/jquery.maskedinput';import 'JS/jquery/growl/jquery.growl';import 'imports-loader?prepareTranslation=&gt;Translation.prepareTranslation./js/jquery/alerts/jquery.alerts';I have tried using require syntax instead of import, but it works the same way.I was able to make jquery available on every js using webpack.ProvidePlugin, but it didn't work for my i18n functions, then I started trying with imports-loaderAny ideas?",javascript
22235,"Selecting text behind another element with createEvent I have a scenario where I have some text, which should be user-selectable. The problem is, that there's an UI overlay on top of it, which prevents selecting text by default. The logical way to keep the overlay and still be able to select the text, would be to use synthetic events (use document.createEvent), but due to some reason, it doesn't work as expected.The events seem to be delegated correctly and fire their handlers, but no text is selected. I have an example here, which is a rough simplification of the problem.A few notesIn Firefox if you start your selection outside of the overlay, you are still able to select the text you want, even if it's under the overlayWhen you have a normal selection in the uncovered area and you click on the overlay, it would be expected from the delegated mousedown event to remove the selection, but it doesn't happenAm I missing an event that should also be delegated (I have mousedown, mousemove and mouseup)? Or is it some kind of a security measure by browsers to disable such behavior (refer to the note nr 2)? Any other suggestions on how to get the desired result? I know I should work around the current overlay solution altogether, but I'm already curious about the problem itself.",javascript

The issue that I'm running into is when the elements are changed or the body is resized the 'window' that the popup is displayed in does not resize.

35925,"UIWebViewDelegate: webViewDidFinishLoad not called during in-page navigation I have an app where users can navigate a pile of locally stored HTML files. I have a UIWebView, configured up correctly with a UIWebViewDelegate. Usually, when the user follows a link, shouldStartLoadWithRequest is called, followed by webViewDidFinishLoad a bit later.But, if the link is pointing to an anchor on the same page as the one which is currently displayed, only shouldStartLoadWithRequest is called. webViewDidFinishLoad does not fire.In a sense, I see that this might be expected behaviour, because in-page navigation should not require a page reload. However, I really need a place to hook into the call stack after in-page navigation is complete. The optimal solution would let me know when any sort of navigation has ended, both from another page, in-page and forward/backward actions.My best hackaround so far has been to call performSelector: withObject: afterDelay: at the end of my shouldStartLoadWithRequest method, but I'm not happy with this.Does anyone know how I can solve this correctly?

1903,"why a tiny reordering of DOM Read/Write operations causes a huge performance difference the following code illustrate the problem, changing the order of Read/Write causes a big difference in execution time (Tested using Chrome, Firefox and IE) :// read-&gt;write-&gt;read-&gt;write...function clearSlow(divs){    Array.prototype.forEach.call(divs, function(div) {        contents.push(div.clientWidth);        div.style.width = ""10px"";    });}// read-&gt;read-&gt;...-&gt;write-&gt;write...function clearFast(divs){    Array.prototype.forEach.call(divs, function(div) {        contents.push(div.clientWidth);    });    Array.prototype.forEach.call(divs, function(div) {        div.style.width = ""10px"";    });}Here's a JSFiddle for the complete example http://jsfiddle.net/Dq3KZ/2/ .My results for n=100 :Slow version : ~35msFast version : ~2msfor n=1000:Slow version : ~2000msFast version : ~25msI think this is related with the number of browser reflow in each case. In the slow scenario, a reflow happens for each write operation. However, in the fast scenario, the reflow occurs only once at the end. But I'm not sure and I don't understand why it does work that way (when the operations are independent).Edit: I used InnerText property instead of clientWidth and Style.Width , I got the same behavior when using Google Chrome (http://jsfiddle.net/pindexis/CW2BF/7/). However, when InnerHTML is used, there's almost no difference (http://jsfiddle.net/pindexis/8E5Yj/). Edit2: I have opened a discussion about the innerHTML/innerText issue for those interested: why does replacing InnerHTML with innerText causes &gt;15X drop in performance",javascript
45526,How to make UILabel text appear with ellipsis at the end when text is longer than label's width My issue is with a UILabel.The text it holds is much longer than the actual width of the UILabel. So I would like it to appear with &quot;...&quot; (an ellipsis) at the end to denote that there's more text.I played around with horizontal content hugging priority (made it less than 251) but it doesn't seem to make a difference.Right now it just chops the text when the width fills up.,ios

45806,Sequence of componentWillMount calls in React.js According to this page http://busypeoples.github.io/post/react-component-lifecycle/ The render method for a component is called right in between the componentWillMount and componentDidMount methods amongst other places.  But the react.js documentation for component lifecycles here https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html says that the componentDidMount methods of all child activities are called before the parent.  I can understand that componentDidMount is ok to call after any child components are rendered but how does the runtime know which children to call the componentWillMount function on before they are rendered?  Or am I right in assuming that componentWillMount is called for the parent activity first and then for the children (unlike componentDidMount)?Thanks!,javascript

I.E: it IS an actual CPU bound problem.Writing with Javascript and testing in it's browser environment is harder to debug than say, Java, .NET or Python running in a decent IDE.But for doing actual large scale web development with complex client side code, it's necessary to at least compile to Javascript, if not directly write in it.Background: Recent advancesEmscripten allows compiling C/C++ to Javascript, that can run with increasing efficiency in the browser due to ArrayBuffer's typed array support and new browser JS engines, as ASM.js and LLJS take advantage of Mozilla's recent speed improvements (that other venders will likely soon follow).Altjs.org has a laundry list of Javascript alternaltives, but doesn't yet focus on the recent speed improvements or nice semantics specifically but it is becoming common place for people to code for browsers with better tools. Emscripten in particular has loads of amazing demos.Possible options already considered:Shedskin - Currently I have tried getting Shedskin working but I have limited C++/C skills (Emscripten only exposes a C API for the Boehm inspired garbage collector it uses, and Shedskin needs a C++ garbage collection class for it's objects, which doesn't exist yet).Unladen Swallow / RPython, to LLVM - have not been able to setup correctly on Ubuntu yetBoo to Java then to LLVM (not been able to setup on my Ubuntu system yet)Additional constraints:I need to use this on my Ubuntu system.The compiled Javascript should probably be less than 1 MBDebugging in the native language which is also cross compiled, should still be possible, allowing taking advantage of existing debug tools.""This process of constructing instruction tables should be very fascinating.

Some values, however, can only be determined when the document is being laid out.

This question is a follow up to my question about sharing resources between web applications, because I have not yet found a good solution.I have a web application with user controls and resources that are shared by three other web applications.Solution|+-CommonControlsWebApp| +- resources| |  +- images| |  +- scripts| |  +- stylesheets| +- UserControls| +-WebApp1| +-WebApp2| +-WebApp3This is what I know this far:I can not compile CommonControlsWebApp into a single dll since I am creating user controls. This is only possible with custom server controls, where everything is in the code-behind file. So I need a way to share the ascx files between the four projects.Copying the files from CommonControlsWebApp into the three other projects does not update their files in the solution explorer. I would have to 'add exting items' all in all three WebApps when a file is added or renamed in CommonControls.Changing to the Web Site model would remedy this, but I am worried about the compile time for WebApp1-3 if I do this.'Add as link' does not work for directories.I could use Subversion to share the files between the projects, but i believe that this would require me to check the files in and out again all the time if I am developing a user control that I have to test through one of the WebApps.Can it really be true that ASP.NET does not have a good solution for this? How are you guys organizing large web applications?Edit: Thanks a lot for all the answers. I am going to copy my user controls with a build event for now, and then see if we have time to refactor them into server controls.",asp.net

45510,"iPad iOS7 - UIImagePickerController in UIPopoverController has wrong preview image I am using an UIImagePickerController within an UIPopoverController which is working perfectly with iOS6. With iOS 7 the ""preview"" image which is shown to capture the image is rotated, but if I take a picture it is saved correctly.This is how I get my picker:UIImagePickerController *imagePicker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];imagePicker.delegate = self;imagePicker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypeCamera;imagePicker.mediaTypes = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:                              (NSString *) kUTTypeImage,                              nil];imagePicker.allowsEditing = NO;And add it to a popover controller:self.imagePickerPopOver = [[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewController:imagePicker];    [self.imagePickerPopOver presentPopoverFromRect:CGRectMake(aPosViewA.x, cameraButton_y, 100.0, 30.0) inView:self.detailViewController.view permittedArrowDirections:UIPopoverArrowDirectionAny animated:YES];Those are calculations for the button position at a UIScrollView to show the popover at the correct position:presentPopoverFromRect:CGRectMake(aPosViewA.x, cameraButton_y, 100.0, 30.0)I don't think that the problem lies there as I have tried out several combinations.I have also tried to capture the image in fullscreen-mode, but the app is only allowed to use landscape mode. If the image is taken in portrait-mode and the modal view is dismissed, the app stays in portrait mode as well. I couldn't find a way to prevent the UIImagePickerController to switch to portrait mode or to force the app back to landscape mode if the modal view was dismissed.UPDATEI have taken the answer from here and came a step further.I transform the view after creating the picker and before showing the popover :switch ([UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation) {        case UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft:            self.imagePicker.view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(M_PI/2);            break;        case UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight:            self.imagePicker.view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(-M_PI/2);            break;        default:            break;    }which works as long as i don't turn around the iPad. For that I am registering for the orientation changed event: [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self  selector:@selector(orientationChanged:)  name:UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification  object:nil];and change the picker view:- (void)orientationChanged:(NSNotification *)notification{    if (self.imagePicker) {        switch ([UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation) {            case UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft:                self.imagePicker.view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(M_PI/2);                break;            case UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight:                self.imagePicker.view.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(-M_PI/2);                break;            default:                break;        }    }}REMAINING PROBLEM:As I wrote in the beginning, when the picture was taken, it was shown correctly to accept or dismiss it. This is now transformed as well. Somehow I need to know when the image is taken and transform it back.AND, this is really a nasty hack and probably won't work with the next iOS Update. Has anybody an idea how to implement that in a cleaner way?UPDATE 2This was too nasty, I have found a cleaner solution which solves my problem but is not the answer to the initial question regarding an imagepicker in a popover controller, which is not recommended by Apple, but allowed.I have subclassed now the UIImagePickerController like this:@implementation QPImagePickerController- (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation {    return UIInterfaceOrientationIsLandscape(toInterfaceOrientation);}- (BOOL)shouldAutorotate {    return YES;}- (NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations{    return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskLandscape;}@endand I am using the imagepicker in fullscreen instead in a popover.

34195,"Using a Bezier Curve to draw a spiral This is for an iPad application, but it is essentially a math question.I need to draw a circular arc of varying (monotonically increasing) line width. At the beginning of the curve, it would have a starting thickness (let's say 2pts) and then the thickness would smoothly increase until the end of the arc where it would be at its greatest thickness (let's say 12pts).I figure the best way to make this is by creating a UIBezierPath and filling the shape. My first attempt was to use two circular arcs (with offset centers), and that worked fine up to 90°, but the arc will often be between 90° and 180°, so that approach won't cut it.My current approach is to make a slight spiral (one slightly growing from the circular arc and one slightly shrinking) using bezier quad or cubic curves.  The question is where do I put the control points so that the deviation from the circular arc (aka the shape ""thickness"") is the value I want.Constraints:The shape must be able to start and end at an arbitrary angle (within 180° of each other)The ""thickness"" of the shape (deviation from the circle) must start and end with the given valuesThe ""thickness"" must increase monotonically (it can't get bigger and then smaller again)It has to look smooth to the eye, there can't be any sharp bendsI am open to other solutions as well.",ios

1949,"Lines missing from tall UILabel when embedding NSTextAttachment I can create a multi-line NSAttributedString by using escaped new-line characters (@""\n""). With iOS 7, I can now embed a UIImage inside attributed strings (via NSTextAttachment).I have noticed that whenever I set the attributedText of a UILabel to a multi-line attributed string with an embedded image, the number of lines actually displayed is inversely proportional to the height of the label. For example, when the height of the label is 80, two lines appear; when the height is around 100, only the second line appears; when the height is about 130, nothing appears.This problem occurred while trying to position multiple UILabels side-by-side inside a UITableViewCell and having the labels grow (vertically) with the cell height.Can anyone explain why this is happening?

And it seems like the time is spent calculating layout for the cells.I've stripped everything from the cell(including custom subclass) and left it with just UILabel, but nothing changed. Then I've changed the style of the cell to Basic(or anything except Custom) and the problem disappeared — new cells are added instantaneously.I've doubled checked and NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate callbacks are called only once. If I ignore them and do [UITableView reloadSections:withRowAnimation:], nothing changes — it is still very slow.It seems to me like Auto Layout is disabled for the default cell styles, which makes them very fast. But if that is the case — why does everything loads quickly when I push the UITableViewController?Here's the call trace for that problem:So the question is — what is going on here? Why are cells being rendered so slowly?UPDATE 1I've built a very simple demo app that illustrates the problem I'm having. here's the source — https://github.com/antstorm/UITableViewCellPerformanceProblemTry adding at least a screenful of cells to feel the performance problems.Also note that adding a row directly (""Insert now!"" button) is not causing any slowness.",ios

13271,"Preventing ""wrapping"" of items in UICollectionView I need a UICollectionView to display a grid that is potentially larger than the visible frame in both width and height, while maintaining row and column integrity.  The default UICollectionViewFlowLayout allows sections to scroll off-screen, but it wraps items within a section to keep them all on-screen, which screws up my grid.  Recognizing that UICollectionView is a subclass of UIScrollView, I tried just manually setting the collection view's content size property in viewDidLoad:self.collectionView.contentSize = CGSizeMake((columns * (cellWidth + itemSpacingX), (rows * (cellHeight + itemSpacingY));But this had no effect.  Questions: Is there an easy way to accomplish this without building a custom layout?Would using a custom layout and overriding the collectionViewContentSize method succeed in getting the collection view to stop wrapping items and scroll in both directions?If I do have to build a custom layout--which I'll have to invest some time to learn--do I subclass UICollectionViewLayout, or would subclassing UICollectionViewFlowLayout save time? UPDATE:I tried embedding the UICollectionView as a subview of a UIScrollView.  The collection view itself is behaving correctly--the rows aren't wrapping at the edge of the scroll view, telling me that it is filling the UIScrollView content size that I set.  But the scroll view doesn't pan in the horizontal direction, i.e. it only scrolls vertically, which the collection view does by itself anyway.  So stuck again.  Could there be an issue with the responder chain?  ",ios

29467,"iOS - UISplitViewController with storyboard - multiple master views and multiple detail views I'm trying to put together an iPad app using UISplitViewController and storyboards.  The master view starts with a navigation controller linked to a table view of 6 menu options.  Each cell in the table pushes a different table view controller onto the navigation stack.  This is working fine for the master view.  Each master view has a table list which when clicked needs to display a different view controller in the detail pane.

24833,"AudioTimeStamp format + 'MusicDeviceMIDIEvent' Can I get a little help with this?In a test project, I have an AUSampler -&gt; MixerUnit -&gt; ioUnit and have a render callback set up. It all works. I am using the MusicDeviceMIDIEvent method as defined in MusicDevice.h to play a midi noteOn &amp; noteOff. So in the hack test code below, a noteOn occurs for .5 sec. every 2 seconds.MusicDeviceMIDIEvent (below) takes a param: inOffsetSampleFrame in order to schedule an event at a future time. What I would like to be able to do is play a noteOn and schedule the noteOff at the same time (without the hack time check I am doing below). I just don't understand what the inOffsetSampleFrame value should be (ex: to play a .5 sec or .2 second note. (in other words, I don't understand the basics of audio timing...).So, if someone could walk me through the arithmetic to get proper values from the incoming AudioTimeStamp, that would be great! Also perhaps correct me/clarify any of these:AudioTimeStamp-&gt;mSampleTime - sampleTime is the time of thecurrent sample ""slice""? Is this in milliseconds?AudioTimeStamp-&gt;mHostTime  - ? host is the computer the app is running on and this is  time (in milliseconds?) since computer started? This is a HUGE number. Doesn't it rollover and then cause problems?inNumberFrames - seems like that is 512 on iOS5 (set throughkAudioUnitProperty_MaximumFramesPerSlice). So the sample is madeup of 512 frames?I've seen lots of admonitions not to overload the render Callbackfunction - in particular to avoid Objective C calls - I understandthe reason, but how does one then message the UI or do otherprocessing?I guess that's it. Thanks for bearing with me!  inOffsetSampleFrame                  If you are scheduling the MIDI Event from the audio unit's render thread, then you can supply a                       sample offset that the audio unit may apply when applying that event in its next audio unit render.                       This allows you to schedule to the sample, the time when a MIDI command is applied and is particularly                       important when starting new notes. If you are not scheduling in the audio unit's render thread,                       then you should set this value to 0// MusicDeviceMIDIEvent function def:extern OSStatusMusicDeviceMIDIEvent(   MusicDeviceComponent    inUnit,                    UInt32                  inStatus,                    UInt32                  inData1,                    UInt32                  inData2,                    UInt32                  inOffsetSampleFrame)//my callbackOSStatus  MyCallback(   void *                          inRefCon,                 AudioUnitRenderActionFlags *   ioActionFlags,                 const AudioTimeStamp *         inTimeStamp,                 UInt32                         inBusNumber,                 UInt32                         inNumberFrames,                 AudioBufferList *              ioData){Float64 sampleTime = inTimeStamp-&gt;mSampleTime;UInt64 hostTime = inTimeStamp-&gt;mHostTime;[(__bridge Audio*)inRefCon audioEvent:sampleTime andHostTime:hostTime];return 1;}  // OBJ-C method- (void)audioEvent:(Float64) sampleTime andHostTime:(UInt64)hostTime{OSStatus result = noErr;Float64 nowTime = (sampleTime/self.graphSampleRate); // sample rate: 44100.0if (nowTime - lastTime &gt; 2) {    UInt32 noteCommand =    kMIDIMessage_NoteOn &lt;&lt; 4 | 0;    result = MusicDeviceMIDIEvent (mySynthUnit, noteCommand, 60, 120, 0);     lastTime = sampleTime/self.graphSampleRate;}if (nowTime - lastTime &gt; .5) {    UInt32   noteCommand =  kMIDIMessage_NoteOff &lt;&lt; 4 | 0;    result = MusicDeviceMIDIEvent (mySynthUnit, noteCommand, 60, 0, 0);}}",ios

33752,"How to use the repository pattern correctly? I am wondering how should I be grouping my repositories? Like from the examples I seen on the asp.net mvc and in my books they basically use one repository per database table. But that seems like a lot of repositories leading you to have to call up many repositories later on for mocking and stuff.So I am guessing I should group them. However I am not sure how to group them.Right now I made a registration Repository to handle all my registration stuff. However there are like 4 tables I need to update and before I had  3 repositories to do this.For example one of the tables is a license table. When they register I look at their key and check it to see if exists in the database. Now what happens if I need to check this license key or something else from that table at some other spot other then registration?One spot could be login(check if the key is not expired). So what would I do in this situation? Rewrite the code again(break DRY)? Try to merege these 2 repositories together and hope that none of the methods are needed in some other point of time(like maybe I might have a method that checks if userName is used - maybe I will need that somewhere else).Also if I merge them together I would either need 2 service layers going to the same repository since I think having all the logic for 2 different parts of a site would be long and I would have to have names like ValidateLogin(), ValdiateRegistrationForm(),ValdiateLoginRetrievePassword() and etc.Or call the Repository anyways and just have a weird sounding name around?It just seems hard to make a repository that has a general enough name so you can use it for many spots of your application and still make sense and I don't think calling another repository in a repository would be a good practice?","c#,asp.net"

In other word, the user would click on a button, the javascript would generate randoms numbers (for example), and put them in a structure.

29843,"Custom segue animation (navigation animation) in SwiftUI In SwiftUI we use NavigationView and NavigationLink views to perform navigations (what we used to call segue in UIKit). The standard segue in UIKit is the show segue. In SwiftUI we can simply do:struct ContentView: View {    var body: some View {        NavigationView {            VStack {                NavigationLink(destination: Text(""Destination"")) {                    Text(""Navigate!"")                }            }        }    }}to have the exact same effect (even if the word segue has disappeared).Sometimes (actually rather often) we need to customise the segue animation. We can decide not to animate the segue at all, indeed in thestoryboard we can find the attribute Animates (true/false) in theattribute inspector by clicking on a segue. This way the destination view controller appears immediately in place of the source view controller.Or we can decide to perform a custom animation. Usually this is done by implementing an object that conforms to the UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning protocol. All the magic happens in the animateTransition method that gives us access to the source view controller and the destination view controller.For example, a simple cross-fade segue animation could be something like:-(void)animateTransition:(id&lt;UIViewControllerContextTransitioning&gt;)transitionContext{    UIView* containerView = [transitionContext containerView];    UIViewController* fromVC = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextFromViewControllerKey];    UIViewController* toVC = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextToViewControllerKey];    toVC.view.alpha = 0;    [containerView addSubview:toVC.view];    [UIView animateWithDuration:1 animations:^{        toVC.view.alpha = 1;        fromVC.view.alpha = 0;    } completion:^(BOOL finished) {        [fromVC.view removeFromSuperview];        [transitionContext completeTransition:YES];    }];}Now the question: how can I get the same in SwiftUI? Is it possible not to animate a navigation or to customise the navigation animation? I expected to be able to do:struct ContentView: View {    var body: some View {        NavigationView {            VStack {                NavigationLink(destination: Text(""Destination"")) {                    Text(""Navigate!"")                }            }        }        .animation(nil)    }}or something similar to prevent the animation (or to add a custom animation), but nothing changes.",ios

So when you create a new MVC 5 project, the following is automatically added to the Web.config to get rid of the forms authentication http module because it is no longer needed when using OWIN middleware:&lt;system.webServer&gt;    &lt;modules&gt;        &lt;remove name=""FormsAuthenticationModule"" /&gt;    &lt;/modules&gt;&lt;/system.webServer&gt;Now since we are removing the module, that means it was previously added, so here is the entry registering this http module in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config:&lt;httpModules&gt;    &lt;add name=""FormsAuthentication"" type=""System.Web.Security.FormsAuthenticationModule"" /&gt;&lt;/httpModules&gt;And here is the entry in C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\config\applicationHost.config for IIS 8.5 that tells my application to use the module:&lt;system.webServer&gt;    &lt;modules&gt;        &lt;add name=""FormsAuthentication"" type=""System.Web.Security.FormsAuthenticationModule"" preCondition=""managedHandler"" /&gt;    &lt;/modules&gt;&lt;/system.webServer&gt;So what is automatically added to my web config at the application level has a name attribute of ""FormsAuthenticationModule"" while the entries in the two server level/asp.net level config files use name attribute ""FormsAuthentication"". So what is going on here? It seems to me that the module won't be removed since the name attribute doesn't match. I would simply think this was a typo, but after searching online, everyone seems to be using ""FormsAuthenticationModule"" in the application web.config.

If you use margin: auto; on a flex item, it acts to center an item on the main axis (see following picture for how a flex-box works).img { width: 100%; height: 100%;}&lt;img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/9Oxw7.png"" alt=""flex-box demo"" /&gt;(That was the best way I could figure out how to get a dropdown-photo...)From what I am understanding, using margin: auto is the current counterpart to the align-selfproperty for the cross axis.Thus one could do this to center a flex item in a flex box in these ways:$(document).on('click', 'button', function(e) {  $this = $(this);  if ($this.attr('id') === 'button1') {    $('h2').parent().attr(""class"", """");    $('h2').attr(""class"", ""toggle1"");  }  if ($this.attr('id') === 'button2') {    $('h2').parent().attr(""class"", """");    $('h2').attr(""class"", ""toggle1"");  }  if ($this.attr('id') === 'button3') {    $('h2').parent().attr(""class"", ""toggle3"");    $('h2').attr(""class"", """");  }  if ($this.attr('id') === 'button4') {    $('h2').parent().attr(""class"", ""toggle4"");    $('h2').attr(""class"", """");  }  if ($this.attr('id') === 'button0') {    $('h2').parent().attr(""class"", """");    $('h2').attr(""class"", """");  }});div:not(.cont),div:not(.cont) * {  border: 1px dotted red;}div {  align-items: center;  display: flex;}button {  margin: 16px;}.toggle1 {  margin: auto;}.toggle2 {  flex: 1;}.toggle3 {  justify-content: center;}.toggle4 {  justify-content: space-between;}&lt;script src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;I'm an h2&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &lt;span&gt;I'm a span!&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;I'm an h2&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;span&gt;I'm a span!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;  &lt;span&gt;I'm a span!&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span&gt;I'm a span!&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;I'm an h2&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;span&gt;I'm a span!&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span&gt;I'm a span!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""cont""&gt;  &lt;button id=""button0""&gt;clear&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;button id=""button1""&gt;margins&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;button id=""button2""&gt;flex-grow&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""cont""&gt;  &lt;button id=""button3""&gt;justify-content: center    &lt;br /&gt;(on parent)&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;button id=""button4""&gt;justify-content: space-around    &lt;br /&gt;(on parent)&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As you can see from the above snippet, it only works if there are the same amount of flex-items on each side of the &lt;h2&gt; (and you can also see that justify-content: space-around does not work with just one object).  But what if there are an unbalanced amount of flex items on each side of the object you are trying to center? - Sure, you could put blank elements there and use flex: 1;, but that seems a bit hacky.My idea is to make use of negative-margins. I read a great article (here) about using negative-margins and how they can pull objects towards them, etc. (plus, even w3 says they are legitimate code - not hacky).The idea is to set &lt;h2&gt; to margin: auto; and then somehow (I emphasis somehow as with all the research I have been doing I am starting to lose hope...) take the width of any sibling flex-item and negate that from the &lt;h2&gt; margin: auto;... sounds hacky and hopefully there is a way to do it without JS/jQuery or a CSS compiler.  Does anyone know of a way to negate from the margin of a flex item the width of a sibling flex item in the same flex-box?Thank you.P.S./UPDATEThere might be a way to accomplish this with the position property; however, all the testing I have done has produced no results... Maybe someone else has been successful with this method?",javascript

10952,"How can I use Material-UI Autocomplete together with react-virtualized? I'm using the Autocomplete component from Material-UI in a project. Since I have a lot of options to render, virtualization would be very beneficial. So I started from the virtualized example in the docs with react-window. Everything worked great, but the project already has a dependency on react-virtualized and I would like to avoid adding a new one that solves something similar. So based on the react-window example, I tried to re-implement it using List from react-virtualized.Code Samplehttps://codesandbox.io/s/sleepy-hypatia-igog8?fontsize=14&amp;hidenavigation=1&amp;module=%2Fsrc%2FVirtualizedAutocomplete.js&amp;theme=darkThe ProblemAs demonstrated in the sandbox above, it's kind of working. What doesn't work is the keyboard navigation. You can navigate using the keyboard, but the Listbox doesn't scroll to the highlighted value when you navigate outside of the visible elements.What I've tried:Overriding onKeyDown for the Autocomplete component. This however completely overrides the keydown functionality, requiring me to re-implement it.Using onKeyUp to keep the onKeyDown functionality and finding the element with the data-focus attribute, and then using scrollToIndex on the List component. This works for some cases, but if the user holds down the key for a while and ends up on an index outside of the overscan rendered items it breaks.Does anyone have a good way of using react-virtualized to virtualize the options in the Material-UI Autoselect component? Should I be using something other than List?My final resort would be to use the useAutocomplete hook and just re-implement the rendering logic, but since I'm only after the virtualization I'd like to avoid this if possible.",javascript

23635,"Returning a Javascript Promise from $.ajax call I am attempting to cast a $.ajax() statement to an es6 Promise and return the es6 promise.

28651,"Deletable Chips in Material UI Multiple Select The Material UI documentation includes an example of a multiple select where the selected options are rendered with the Chip component by using the renderValue prop on the Select.  The standard behavior for the Select component is that clicking on the current value opens the list of options.I am trying to tweak this so that the Chips show the X button, and clicking on the X should instantly remove that item from the selections rather than opening the options list.That seems easy, but I can't get the onDelete event of the Chip to fire.

43469,"How to implement client certificates and server authentication for iOS I have recently gone through an extremely arduous process to build something that should be very simple yet appears to be essentially un-findable in any one place. I’d like to try to put everything here to ask if I’m doing anything wrong and, if not, to help anyone who needs this information.Background: The product/service for which I was trying to provide security is built around WCF services on a Windows server that are accessible only though custom client apps on a PC or an iPad. One server per customer, no browser access. Everything was already TLS secured with authentication and authorization using Windows standard mechanisms and certs from a commercial CA.To further restrict access, client/server certificates were implemented for the Windows platform using self-signed certificates (commercial CAs are not required in cases where there is mutual authentication with no public/browser access – despite claims to the contrary - and they are harder to manage).Getting all this to work for the iPad was a terribly documented nightmare with an amazing amount of disinformation or partially correct recommendations. In what follows, I have tried to link to the best sources but I apologize if I have inadvertently missed an attribution. Please comment if there is anything wrong/misleading about this post.Thanks",ios

43282,"UIAlertController won't display - In Swift I have created a ContactUsViewController. In this controller the user will select a option from a pickerView and then type a message in a textView and press the Send Email button.

Now, when the email is either Sent, Saved, Cancelled or Failed, the MFMailComposeViewController closes as they are back in my app. I want an alert to then appear to give them an update, on what ever just happened. I have originally set this up using a UIAlertView, and have placed this code in the fun mailComposeController function, see below:func mailComposeController(controller: MFMailComposeViewController, didFinishWithResult result: MFMailComposeResult, error: NSError?) {    switch result.rawValue {    case MFMailComposeResultCancelled.rawValue:        NSLog(""Email cancelled"")    case MFMailComposeResultSaved.rawValue:        NSLog(""Email saved"")        let sendMailErrorAlert = UIAlertView(title: ""Email saved"", message: ""Your email has been saved in Mail."", delegate: self, cancelButtonTitle: ""OK"")        sendMailErrorAlert.show()    case MFMailComposeResultSent.rawValue:        NSLog(""Email sent"")        let alertController = UIAlertController(title: ""test"", message: ""test"", preferredStyle: .Alert)        let okButton = UIAlertAction(title: ""Okay"", style: .Default, handler: nil)        alertController.addAction(okButton)        presentViewController(alertController, animated: true, completion: nil)    case MFMailComposeResultFailed.rawValue:        NSLog(""Email failed: %@"", [error!.localizedDescription])        let sendMailErrorAlert = UIAlertView(title: ""Oops!"", message: ""Looks like something went wrong, and the email couldn't send. Please try again later."", delegate: self, cancelButtonTitle: ""OK"")        sendMailErrorAlert.show()    default:        break    }As you can see, I have used the UIAlertView for Email Saved and Email failed. This works absolutely fine, and shows my alert as expected.I recently read that UIAlertView is depreciated since iOS 8, and that we should now use UIAlertController. Therefore I tried creating the same thing using the UIAlertController, which you can see for the Email Sent section. However, this doesn't seem to work, it just doesn't show any alert.

1286,"Why does a strong reference to parent UIViewController in performBatchUpdates leak an activity? I just finished debugging a very nasty UIViewController leak, such that the UIViewController was not dealloc'd even after calling dismissViewControllerAnimated.I tracked down the issue to the following block of code:    self.dataSource.doNotAllowUpdates = YES;    [self.collectionView performBatchUpdates:^{        [self.collectionView reloadItemsAtIndexPaths:@[indexPath]];    } completion:^(BOOL finished) {        self.dataSource.doNotAllowUpdates = NO;    }];Basically, if I make a call to performBatchUpdates and then immediately call dismissViewControllerAnimated, the UIViewController gets leaked and the dealloc method of that UIViewController never gets called. The UIViewController hangs around forever.Can someone explain this behavior? I assume performBatchUpdates runs over some time interval, say, 500 ms, so I would assume that after said interval, it would call these methods and then trigger the dealloc.The fix appears to be this:    self.dataSource.doNotAllowUpdates = YES;    __weak __typeof(self)weakSelf = self;    [self.collectionView performBatchUpdates:^{        __strong __typeof(weakSelf)strongSelf = weakSelf;        if (strongSelf) {            [strongSelf.collectionView reloadItemsAtIndexPaths:@[indexPath]];        }    } completion:^(BOOL finished) {        __strong __typeof(weakSelf)strongSelf = weakSelf;        if (strongSelf) {            strongSelf.dataSource.doNotAllowUpdates = NO;        }    }];Note that the BOOL member variable, doNotAllowUpdates, is a variable I added that prevents any kind of dataSource / collectionView updates while a call to performBatchUpdates is running. I searched around for discussion online about whether or not we should use the weakSelf/strongSelf pattern in performBatchUpdates, but did not find anything specifically on this question.I am happy that I was able to get to the bottom of this bug, but I would love a smarter iOS developer to explain to me this behavior I am seeing.",ios

The most common theme I read about why to use node.js is for high scalability due to it's evented, non-blocking I/O model.  I'm trying to understand other non-scalability uses cases (and aside from being used as a general server-side javascript engine).Does node.js have other use cases if scalability isn't a concern of mine?If yes to #1, what are they?Is node.js usage appropriate for any particular type of application architectures?  E.g. similar to how some key/value (nosql - ugh I hate that term) databases are useful other than for scalability reasons.",javascript
44535,"Viima JQuery Comments - GetUsers(Pinged users) displaying incorrectly in partialview Referencesjquery commentsThe jquery comments documentationthis issue in githubAttachmentscomments-data.js is test data : Download herejquery-comments.js creates the whole comments system: Download herejquery-comments.min.js if you require it: Download hereDescriptionI have a view with a list of ""articles"" with a ""read more"" button on each ""article"" in the list. When I click on the read more button a modal opens up with a partial view with the jquery comments in it. However, when I search for the pinged users (using the @ sign), the list of users don't show by the textarea, but instead higher up in the modal (far from the textarea).Below is an image, then below that is my code. You will see at the bottom of the image I have put the '@' sign and the list of users is displayed on the top, it should be by the textarea. It also seems that when I click on the articles lower in the list, the higher the list of users display when I push the '@' sign:MVC ViewBelow is the part populating the ""Articles"" from where the Modal is being called from:@{    int iGroupNameId = 0;

48317,"iOS 8 Photos framework. Access photo metadata I'm looking at replacing ALAssetsLibrary with Photos framework in my app.I can retrieve photos, collections, and asset sources just fine (even write them back out), but don't see anywhere to access the metadata of the photos (the dictionaries such as {Exif}, {TIFF}, {GPS}, etc...).ALAssetsLibrary has a way. UIImagePickerController has a way. Photos must have a way too. I see that PHAsset has a location property which will do for the GPS dictionary, but I'm looking to access all of the metadata which include faces, orientation, exposure, ISO, and tons more. Currently apple is at beta 2. Perhaps there are more APIs to come ?UPDATEThere is no official way to do this using only Photos APIs.However you can read the metadata after you download the image data. There are a couple of methods to do this using either PHImageManager or PHContentEditingInput. The PHContentEditingInput method required less code and doesn't require you to import ImageIO. I've wrapped it up in a PHAsset category. ",ios
791,"Create breadcrumbs dynamically on client side using javascript I want to create breadcrumbs dynamically on client side using java script. The breadcrumbs will be the path followed by user while navigation as:Home > about us > our history..The anchor tags will be generated on each page in the sequence in which the user navigate.Now I can create these breadcrumbs using server side technology easily but I want to generate it dynamically on each page on client side.Now I don't know exactly how to implement it.Some logic in my mind is as: Create an object type variable in java script with a nameand value pair where name is the name of current pageand value is the url of that page.  Now pass this object    variable using query string while navigating from one page to    other.Then in the second page get that object variable from query stringand extract the name and value pair from that object and then usingthat create the anchor and add it to targeted div (place holder). Again when user goes to another page add the name and value pairsfor all the previous pages along with the name and value pair for current page at the last in the object variable and pass it to next pageusing query string. Now in next page do the same and create anchors.Some what similar I got here using html5 client side storage as:html:&lt;ul id=""navigation_links""&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Page1&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Page2&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Page3&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;js:$(document).ready(function(){    bindEventToNavigation();});function bindEventToNavigation(){    $.each($(""#navigation_links &gt; li""), function(index, element){        $(element).click(function(event){            breadcrumbStateSaver($(event.currentTarget).html());            showBreadCrumb();        });    });}function breadcrumbStateSaver(text){    //here we'll check if the browser has storage capabilities    if(typeof(Storage) != ""undefined""){        if(sessionStorage.breadcrumb){            //this is how you retrieve the breadcrumb from the storage            var breadcrumb = sessionStorage.breadcrumb;           sessionStorage.breadcrumb = breadcrumb + "" &gt;&gt; ""+text;        } else {           sessionStorage.breadcrumb = """"+text;         }    }    //if not you can build in a failover with cookies}function showBreadCrumb(){     $(""#breadcrumb"").html(sessionStorage.breadcrumb);   }&lt;div id=""breadcrumb""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;but here instead of creating hyperlinked anchors it is creating simple text, whereas I want the breadcrumbs to be anchors and hyperlinked to their respective pages.I am new to java script and don't know how to implement this.If you have any better logic and solution for this please tell me.thanks in advance.",javascript

33368,"jQuery AJAX polling for JSON response, handling based on AJAX result or JSON content I'm a novice-to-intermediate JavaScript/jQuery programmer, so concrete/executable examples would be very much appreciated.My project requires using AJAX to poll a URL that returns JSON containing either content to be added to the DOM, or a message { ""status"" : ""pending"" } that indicates that the backend is still working on generating a JSON response with the content. The idea is that the first request to the URL triggers the backend to start building a JSON response (which is then cached), and subsequent calls check to see if this JSON is ready (in which case it's provided).In my script, I need to poll this URL at 15-second intervals up to 1:30 mins., and do the following:If the AJAX request results in an error, terminate the script.If the AJAX request results in success, and the JSON content contains { ""status"" : ""pending"" }, continue polling.If the AJAX request results in success, and the JSON content contains usable content (i.e. any valid response other than { ""status"" : ""pending"" }), then display that content, stop polling and terminate the script.I've tried a few approaches with limited success, but I get the sense that they're all messier than they need to be. Here's a skeletal function I've used with success to make a single AJAX request at a time, which does its job if I get usable content from the JSON response:// make the AJAX requestfunction ajax_request() {  $.ajax({    url: JSON_URL, // JSON_URL is a global variable    dataType: 'json',    error: function(xhr_data) {      // terminate the script    },    success: function(xhr_data) {      if (xhr_data.status == 'pending') {        // continue polling      } else {        success(xhr_data);      }    },    contentType: 'application/json'  });}However, this function currently does nothing unless it receives a valid JSON response containing usable content.I'm not sure what to do on the lines that are just comments. I suspect that another function should handle the polling, and call ajax_request() as needed, but I don't know the most elegant way for ajax_request() to communicate its results back to the polling function so that it can respond appropriately.Any help is very much appreciated!

I'm trying to implement auth between a Next.js frontend and a Rails API backend, and I'm having difficulty understanding the how to properly do this securely.I'm using the jwt-sessions gem on the rails side, which upon login returns an access_token, a refresh_token and a csrf token. The csrf can only be sent via header, and is required for all non-GET or HEAD requests.

Keep CSRF in localStorage, but the other tokens in httpOnly cookies set by the server.This seems the most secure, but then SSR via getInitialProps won't work at all, because it can't send the cookies via fetch. I can't even manually send them because I can't see them in JS.Option 2: non httpOnly CookiesThis is what the official next example seems to do (albeit with a single, probably stateless token)Either have the server or the browser set the cookie without httpOnly.I can access it via SSR, but doesn't this open me up to XSS?Option 3: Use Browser StorageJust put all the tokens in localStorage and/or sessionStorage.

Apple blocked the 'autoplay' parameter for the right reasons, but sometimes you still need to get this functionality working.

19826,"What are the different ways for calling my method on separate thread? I have some data calculation method (let it be ""myMethod:""), and I want to move the call to another thread because I don't want to block my main UI functionality. So, started to do some research on how to call my method on another thread. As far as I see, currently, there are a lot of different ways for doing that. Here's a list:a) using pure threads (available since iOS 2.0): [NSThread detachNewThreadSelector:@selector(myMethod:) toTarget:self withObject:_myParamsArray];b) using a simple shortcut (available since iOS 2.0). Available from inherited NSObject but the method belongs to NSThread class too:[self performSelectorInBackground:@selector(myMethod:) withObject:_myParamsArray];c) using a new approach of Grand Central Dispatch queues (available since iOS 4.0):dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(0, 0),  ^ {      [self myMethod:_myParamsArray];    });d) somehow, using some classes such as NSOperation, NSBlockOperation or NSOperationQueue, though not sure how exactly to do it (some example would be appreciated)  Currently, I have used case ""b"" but curious about pros and cons and other related suggestions on that.  UPDATE: e) also found another way for performing similar threading stuff - Run loops. Here's an excerpt from apple docs:  A run loop is an event processing loop that you use to schedule work and coordinate the receipt of incoming events. The purpose of a run loop is to keep your thread busy when there is work to do and put your thread to sleep when there is none.IMHO, more or less your are dealing with the same task - how to call your method on separate thread for its async operation. UPDATE2: Already had some experience with NSInvocationOperation and NSOperationQueue and IMHO it's quite convenient. According to Apple docs, GCD and NSOperations are a preferred way for implementing multithreading. And also, NSOperations runs on GCD starting from iOS 4.0. In short, you instantiate NSIvocationOperation (as a call to your method) then instantiate NSOperationQueue and add invocation to the queue. NSOperationQueue is smart thing enough, you can instantiate multiple NSIvocationOperation objects (wrapping your method calls) and them to NSOperationQueue. The rest is assured. NSOperationQueue determines  how much parallel threads it need to perform the calls (NSInvocationOperation) and handles it for you. It might execute first call on thread A, then second on thread B, third on thread C and forth on thread B, so you do not have to worry about that. But if you want, you may tell how max threads NSOperationQueue can use for performing calls (for example 1) but I have no need for that. By default, all tasks are performed on other than main thread, so operation queues are asynchronous by default. Also, if you want to perform your method calls (each wrapped in separate NSInvocationOperation) in a strict queue then you can add dependencies and so NSOperationQueue will preserve method call order. Here's an example:// wrap your method call into NSInvocationOperation objectNSInvocationOperation *currentOperation = [[NSInvocationOperation alloc] initWithTarget:self selector:@selector(yourMethodCall) object:nil];// _sharedOperationQueue is a shared NSOperationQueue // get all executing operations from the queue and get the last operation_lastOperation = [[_sharedOperationQueue operations] lastObject];// check if _lastOperation is not nilif (_lastOperation) {    // if not then add dependency, so the calls would be performed in a queue    [currentOperation addDependency:_lastOperation];}// say - execute my method (operation)[_sharedOperationQueue addOperation:currentOperation];_lastOperation = currentOperation; // mark as last operation for adding dependency to the next operation// the queue will retain invocation operation so you will release[currentOperation release]; ..... you can create another NSInvocationOperation and add it to the queue....As for RUNLOOPs, still, sometimes you will face them, for example when starting/scheduling a timer, or making NSURL connections. IMHO, a runloop might be compared to a queue of tasks  executed on one thread. IMHO a runloop is a pointer to a thread that operates as a queue: it has tasks that might throw events and they will be placed at the end of the queue in that thread. By default all tasks in your app run in a single runloop - in a single thread. I'm saying it's a pointer because when your app generates events then the app must know where to put that event (touch event or other delegate callback) for execution. Of course, you should read about runloops for more detailed information because these are just my thoughts.",ios
1118,"UICollectionView content is hidden after reloadData I have a UICollectionView that displays content from an NSFetchedResultsController. The collectionView has one section, and in that section there's a header. The header allows the user to filter the content in the collection view. The header view's delegate is connected to the UIViewController containing the collection view.As soon as the user changes one of the filter options, the header view fires a message to its delegate. The delegate changes the predicate on the fetchRequest of its NSFetchedResultsController and calls -[NSFetchedResultsController performFetch:]. Next, the collection view has to be notified that the content has changed. This can be done in several ways, but the way I prefer is by calling -[UICollectionView reloadData]. Unfortunately this method does not work like expected: the entire collection view disappears when I call this method. These are some of the observations I made regarding this issue:All cells and the header of the first (and only) section have their hidden flag set to YES. I tried to trace what method caused this by setting a symbolic breakpoint on -[UIView setHidden:]. Unfortunately it never breaks inside a UICollectionView subview.collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath: is never called after calling -[UICollectionView reloadData].collectionView:viewForSupplementaryElementOfKind:atIndexPath: is never called after calling -[UICollectionView reloadData].numberOfSectionsInCollectionView: is still called and still returns the correct number (1 in this case).collectionView:numberOfItemsInSection is still called and still returns the correct number (1 in this case).What I have tried so far to solve the issue:disabling all customizations (sectionInset, itemSize) on the UICollectionViewFlowLayout instancedisabling all customizations (separatorInset) on the UICollectionView instancehave the header added as a subview to UICollectionView and setting the contentInset accordingly. Unfortunately UICollectionView does not like me to temper with its auto layout constraints and crashes when I do so.call [UICollectionView reloadSections:] instead of [UICollectionView reloadData]. This works but I don't like the animation.manually insert, delete and update rows in the first section. This works as long as the view controller containing the collection view is in memory. As soon as it deallocates, the app crashes with an assertion failure in -[UICollectionView dealloc].It does not feel right to have the header setup this way, but unfortunately UICollectionView does not have a global header like UITableView (tableHeaderView).

11419,"What is the proper method/accepted standard for loading data asynchronously into table view cells? Many apps such as Tweetbot, Twitterrific, Alien Blue, etc. that display images from an API seem to load them in an asynchronous manner. It seems the initial viewable images are loaded synchronously – that is the initial viewable cells aren't displayed until their images are ready – but when scrolling further down past the initial viewable cells, it seems the images for those new cells are loaded independently of the initial synchronous load.For example, when the user loads tweets in a Twitter app, the initial six or seven tweets that will be visible aren't shown until the images for the users' avatars have loaded, but for the 40+ tweets after that (that aren't visible until the user scrolls), we don't have to wait for those images to have loaded in order to display the initial cells, as they're not even visible yet. It seems most apps allow those images to load independently allowing the initial tweets to show up quicker.I'm confused how to best accomplish this, for example if there's a standard way that most developers go about doing this that I'm not aware of.I'm accustomed to using Core Data by supplying objects to Core Data from the response, then NSFetchedResultsController displays them within the table view. However this has the negative affect of requiring everything to be fully loaded and stored in objects before the cells can be displayed. This means that if the API returns an image link to me and I want to display that image within the cell, I have to load the link into a UIImage and add it to Core Data.So my question basically boils down to: what do popular apps such as Tweetbot, Twitterrific, Alien Blue, etc. do to handle table views with a lot of images and data needing to be loaded, but still permit very quick loading, without having to load unnecessary data, and still maintaining high scrolling performance?",ios

The thing is after login, main page appears and everything is listed great. When you click on an item it goes to detailed screen but when you try to go back it just crashes. I found this flow Why does my SwiftUI app crash when navigating backwards after placing a `NavigationLink` inside of a `navigationBarItems` in a `NavigationView`? but i could not solve my problem. Since my project become complicated, I just wanted to practice navigation in swiftui and I created a new project. By the way I downloaded the latest xcode version 11.3. I wrote a simple code as follows: NavigationView{        NavigationLink(destination: Test()) {            Text(""Show Detail View"")        }    .navigationBarTitle(""title1"")And Test() view is as follows:import SwiftUIstruct Test: View {    var body: some View {        Text(""Hello, World!"")    }}struct Test_Previews: PreviewProvider {    static var previews: some View {        Test()    }}As you can see it is really simple. I also  tried similar examples on the internet but it does not work the way it suppose to work. When I run the project, I click the navigation link and it navigates to Test() view. Then I click back button and it navigates to the main page. However, when I click the navigation link second time, nothing happens. Navigation link works only once and after that nothing happens. It does not navigate, it des not throw any error. I am new to swiftui and everything is great but the navigation. I tried many examples and suggested solutions on the internet, but nothing seems to fix my issues. ",ios

30367,"Caching Data for iOS/Android mobile Apps to work with Pagination Give the following scenario. I have a mobile App on iOS/Android which is connected to a server backend via REST. Within the app you can display news items. These items can be created, edited and deleted of you are the creator of the item. On one page in the app there is a news feed where you can see an overview of news items created by other app users. The iOS/Android app stores the data of these news items in a local sqlite database. When the user scrolls down the list of items further items should be loaded if there are any.The task I want to solve is how the items will be cached in the SQLite database to work with pagination. The cache must be updated sometimes when items are deleted or reordered on the server. This must be taken into account when working with pagination.Here is the algorithm I've used so far: if the feed page opens check if there are any items to display in the sqlite databaseif true retrieve p items with offset offset=0 from the database and contact the server to check if the first p items should be updated or deletedif items should be updated or deleted perform these operations on the items in displayelse contact the server for p items with offset offset=0 and display them if the user scrolls down start 1. again with offset = offset + pHow does caching data for mobile apps work with pagination?",ios

App is written in Flutter and we uses flutter_inappwebview for that purpose. There are 2 paths when completing a pruchase: Bank app exists, and the project can open that bank app and complete the payment there. Successful return is implemented using app links for Android and universal links for iOS. This flow works perfectly.There is no bank app and user is presented with Chrome Custom Tabs or SFSafariViewController, where he needs to complete the entire payment flow consisting of few screens (steps to enter bank info, then verifying pin or sms, and last is success screen). Last screen is the one with ""redirect url"" found in the url opened (one of the parameters of the url, not the entire url). When using WebView (InAppBrowser class in that plugin), there is a callback onLoadStop where I can recognize redirect and monitor if this ""return url"" is found when redirecting on last screen of payment.

For example, annotations can be like this:[Required(ErrorMessage = ""Please add the message"")][Display(Name = ""Message"")]But, in my case, there is no model included on a page, and controller action that is being called from the form receives plane strings as method arguments.This is form code:@using (Html.BeginForm(""InsertRssFeed"", ""Rss"", FormMethod.Post, new { @id = ""insertForm"", @name = ""insertForm"" })){&lt;!-- inside this div goes entire form for adding rssFeed, or for editing it --&gt;    ...            &lt;div class=""form-group""&gt;                &lt;label class=""col-sm-2 control-label""&gt; Name:&lt;/label&gt;                &lt;div class=""col-sm-10""&gt;                    &lt;div class=""controls""&gt;                        @Html.Editor(""Name"", new { htmlAttributes = new { @class = ""form-control"", @id = ""add_rssFeed_name"" } })                    &lt;/div&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;                &lt;div class=""form-group""&gt;                    &lt;label class=""col-sm-2 control-label""&gt; URL:&lt;/label&gt;                    &lt;div class=""col-sm-10""&gt;                        &lt;div class=""controls""&gt;                            @Html.Editor(""Url"", new { htmlAttributes = new { @class = ""form-control"", @id = ""add_rssFeed_Url"" } })                        &lt;/div&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;                &lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;            &lt;!-- ok and cancel buttons. they use two css classes.  button-styleCancel is grey button and button-styleOK is normal orange button --&gt;        &lt;div class=""modal-footer""&gt;            &lt;button type=""button"" class=""button-styleCancel"" data-dismiss=""modal""&gt;Close&lt;/button&gt;            &lt;button type=""submit"" class=""button-styleOK"" id=""submitRssFeed""&gt;Save RSS Feed&lt;/button&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;}You can see that form is sending two text fields (Name and Url) to the RssController action method, that accepts these two string parameters:[HttpPost]public ActionResult InsertRssFeed(string Name, string Url){    if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(Name.Trim()) &amp; !String.IsNullOrEmpty(Url.Trim()))    {        var rssFeed = new RssFeed();        rssFeed.Name = Name;        rssFeed.Url = Url;        using (AuthenticationManager authenticationManager = new AuthenticationManager(User))        {            string userSid = authenticationManager.GetUserClaim(SystemClaims.ClaimTypes.PrimarySid);            string userUPN = authenticationManager.GetUserClaim(SystemClaims.ClaimTypes.Upn);            rssFeedService.CreateRssFeed(rssFeed);        }    }    return RedirectToAction(""ReadAllRssFeeds"", ""Rss"");}If the page would have model, validation would be done with @Html.ValidationSummary method, but as I said I am not using modelview object on a page. Is there a way to achieve this kind of validation without using ModelView object, and how to do that? Thanks.","c#,asp.net"

9839,"How to use HTTP Live Streaming protocol in iPhone SDK 3.0 I have developed on IPhone application and submitted to App store. But my application got rejected based on below criteria.   Thank you for submitting your yyyyyyyy  application.  We have reviewed your  application and have determined that  it cannot be posted to the App Store  at this time because it is not using  the HTTP Live Streaming protocol to  broadcast streaming video. HTTP Live  Streaming is required when streaming  video feeds over the cellular network,  in order to have an optimal user  experience and utilize cellular best  practices. This protocol automatically  determines bandwidth available to  users and adjusts the bandwidth  appropriately, even as bandwidth  streams change.  This allows you the  flexibility to have as many streams as  you like, as long as 64 kbps is set as  the baseline feed.In my apps I have to stream prerecorded m4v and mp3 files from my server. I used MPMoviePlayerController to stream and play those videos / audio. How to implement the HTTP Live Streaming Protocol in my apps? Also can I get some sample code?Thanks in advance!",ios

I would like to cache the responses I get back from different requests. i.e. with my setRequestString you will see there is a string input parameter, so i can request different  rss feeds with the same method.. I need to figure out how to cache these responses into individual caches.. but im not sure where to start with it.FinallyIf you have made it this far, thank you very much for reading my question.

I followed these steps:1. Update the Gemfile and bundle:gem 'importmap-rails'gem 'stimulus-rails'2.

Where it breaks down is in Internet Explorer and Opera. What happens is that the render() function in main.js executes, and all three alerts are fired, but the document in the &lt;iframe&gt; is not overwritten. I can't tell what document is being created or written to, or if one is at all.If I add debug code (like console.log(document)) in the beginning of the render() function, the working browsers seem to get a handle on the existing &lt;iframe&gt; document and list the properties included below. Internet Explorer also appears to find a document of some sort. I just can't tell why it's not letting me overwrite it.Could it be an issue of scope? Maybe I'm using the document.write(), document.open() or document.close() methods improperly, and Firefox and a few other browsers are just letting me get away with it?One possible clue: if I take the guts of the render() function out (i.e., just put them after load() in main.js), this works fine. That suggests to me that it's not how I'm using document.open(), etc., but that somehow by the time that the callback() function is executed, the document object is not available, or has gone out of scope, or something like that.This has me totally stumped, and it's for a very important project with an impending deadline.

I search through the data, and when I find one user with the email that matches req.body.email, I compare the password with the one stored in the database.I followed the promise structure outlined in this Firebase blog post.router.post('/login', function(req, res) {  const ref = db.ref('/users');  ref.orderByChild('email')    .equalTo(req.body.email)    .once('child_added')    .then(function (snapshot) {      return snapshot.val();    })    .then(function (usr) {      // Do my thing, throw any errors that come up    })    .catch(function (err) {      // Handle my errors with grace      return;    });});If no child is found at ref, the function does not proceed (see this answer). I don't even get an error thrown.My goal is to run code when no user is found with a certain email (i.e. no child is found at ref that satisfies .equalTo(req.body.email)), but not run the code if a user is found. No error is thrown when nothing is found.I tried adding return statements at strategic points in the call to the database (at the end of my .then() promises) with the intention of breaking out of the endpoint entirely after the code was run. I then put code after the call to the database:    .then(function (usr) {      // Do my thing, throw any errors that come up    })    .catch(function (err) {      // Handle my errors with grace      return;    });  res.status(401)    .json({      error: 'No user found',    )};  return;});but this code is run whether the call to the database succeeds or not, since the call is asynchronous.How do I react to this call to the database if it doesn't return anything and still use Firebase promises?",javascript

34411,"iOS Safari 8 input overflow scroll I have an issue with form fields on mobile Safari, version 8.1. This appears to be a bug with all version of Safari 8 on mobile.When you type text into an input and that text is then longer than the input itself, the cursor keeps moving right as you type - this is correct. The problem is when you hold to select and try to move left to the text that is hidden, you cannot scroll. Likewise, if you select outside the input, you cannot scroll right to view the hidden text.Your only choice is to select all and delete.Any workaround to this problem?

6788,"EF Caching: How to detach objects *completely* before inserting them into HttpRuntime cache? Some background:Working with: .NET 4.5 (thinking of migrating to 4.5.1 if it's painless)Web FormsEntity Framework 5, Lazy Loading enabledContext Per Request IIS 8 Windows 2012 DatacenterPoint of concern: Memory UsageOver the project we are currently on, and probably our first bigger project, we're often reading some bigger chunks of data, coming from CSV imports, that are likely to stay the same for very long periods of time.Unless someone explicitly re-imports the CSV data, they are guaranteed to be the same, this happens in more than one places in our project and similar approach is used for some regular documents that are often being read by the users. We've decided to cache this data in the HttpRuntime cache.It goes like this, and we pull about 15,000 records consisting mostly of strings. //myObject and related methods are placeholderspublic static List&lt;myObject&gt; GetMyCachedObjects(){    if (CacheManager.Exists(KeyConstants.keyConstantForMyObject))    {        return CacheManager.Get(KeyConstants.keyConstantForMyObject) as List&lt;myObject&gt;;    }    else    {        List&lt;myObject&gt; myObjectList = framework.objectProvider.GetMyObjects();        CacheManager.Add(KeyConstants.keyConstantForMyObject, myObjectList, true, 5000);        return myObjectList;    }}The data retrieving for the above method is very simple and looks like this:public List&lt;myObject&gt; GetMyObjects(){    return context.myObjectsTable.AsNoTracking().ToList();}There are probably things to be said about the code structure, but that's not my concern at the moment. I began profiling our project as soon as I saw high memory usage and found many parts where our code could be optimized. I never faced 300 simultaneous users before and our internal tests, done by ourselves were not enough to show the memory issues. I've highlighted and fixed numerous memory leaks but I'd like to understand some Entity Framework related unknowns. Given the above example, and using ANTS Profiler, I've noticed that 'myObject', and other similar objects, are referencing many System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.myObject, additionally there are lots of EntityKeys which hold on to integers. They aren't taking much but their count is relatively high.For instance 124 instances of 'myObject' are referencing nearly 300 System.Data.Entity.DynamicProxies.Usually it looks like this, whatever the object is:Some cache entry, some object I've cached and I now noticed many of them have been detached from dbContext prior caching, the dynamic proxies and the objectContext. I've no idea how to untie them.My progress:I did some research and found out that I might be caching something Entity Framework related together with those objects. I've pulled them with NoTracking but there are still those DynamicProxies in the memory which probably hold on to other things as well.Important: I've observed some live instances of ObjectContext (74), slowly growing, but no instances of my unitOfWork which is holding the dbContext. Those seem to be disposed properly per request basis.I know how to detach, attach or modify state of an entry from my dbContext, which is wrapped in a unitOfWork, and I often do it. However that doesn't seem to be enough or I am asking for the impossible.Questions:Basically, what am I doing wrong with my caching approach when it comes to Entity Framework?Is the growing number of Object Contexts in the memory a concern, I know the cache will eventually expire but I'm worried of open connections or anything else this context might be holding.Should I be detaching everything from the context before inserting it into the cache?If yes, what is the best approach. Especially with List I cannot think of anything else but iterating over the collection and call detach one by one.Bonus question: About 40% of the consumed memory is free (unallocated), I've no idea why .NET is reserving so much free memory in advance.",asp.net

38749,"Ionic 2 fileTransfer.download not reacting on iOS I've developed an Ionic 2 App on Android and am now trying to bring it to work on iOS.The App downloads alot of files on initial login and I do that with the Ionic-Native Transfer plugin. On Android everything works fine, but on iOS the App seems to stuck in the promise of the fileTransfer.download() function, it doesnt even throw an error.Example Code:private downloadFile(downloadURL: string, filename: string) {    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {        this.fileTransfer.download(downloadURL, this.file.dataDirectory + filename, true).then(_ =&gt; {            console.log(""download of "" + filename + "" complete"");            resolve(""download finished"");        }).catch(err =&gt; {            console.log(err);            reject(""download error"");        });    });}I also tried to use the this.file.documentsDirectory instead for iOS but I still dont get any error or success outputs.The downloadURL's are from an firebaseStorage link but I also tested it with a usual download URL.I assume it does have something to do with permissions, but have not found a solution yet. The other assumption would be, that there is a limit to multiple threads on iOS there are about betwenn 30-100 promises live.But the strange thing are the missing error messages, it just get stuck and not a single download finishes.Any help is appreciated!EDIT:I still have not figured out the cause of the problem, but in the meantime, Ionic released a new version of the Transfer Plugin, which is now called FileTransfer in the official docs. Once I changed my code to use the new FileTransfer plugin, the problem disappeared.I hope this helps others who faced the same problem.",ios
4778,"Fastest way to dynamically update the style of millions of DOM elements I've built Conway's Game of Life in the browser just using the DOM. Nothing speical, it's been done before. My goal is to optimize it as best as I can. My actual Game of Life code works fine, and is fast enough for my liking. The bottleneck occurs in updating the screen state. With hundreds of thousands or millions of DOM elements on the screen, you can imagine that this can be quite slow (although faster than I first thought). My question is:Working with upwards of a million DOM elements on the screen at a time, what is the fastest way to iterate through a list of DOM elements and individually change their style?I'm using a class to keep track of styles, would it be better to dynamically change their style instead of class? I'm keeping all these elements in a multidimensional array, would it be better to iterate through another way (the loop itself is not a bottleneck, there are many such loops in my code that run fast enough for me)? I don't really know anything about ""reflows"" or how the browser renders things when elements change. Could these ideas be leveraged in a way that increases performance?Here is my current code:var updateUI = function () {    for (var i = 0; i &lt; width; i++) {        var row = grid[i];        var rowUI = gridUI[i];        for (var j = 0; j &lt; height; j++) {            rowUI[j].className = ""b"" + row[j];        }    }}with the class style being:.b1 {    background: #000;}http://jsfiddle.net/WE5jQ/",javascript

19378,"How to find Objective-C Blocks in Allocations or Leaks Instruments First time question, so don't hold that against me...For standard objects as well as sub-classes that I create, it is fairly straightforward to find in the Allocations or the Leaks Instruments a particular object.  i.e. if I want to see a subclass of UIViewController called ViewController, I can scroll through the Allocations instrument and see the number of living objects increasing and decreasing.  Similarly, if that object is leaked the Leaks Instrument will list it.  I can even search for specific objects.However, I'm not sure what to look for when looking for Objective-C blocks.  I've noticed in the Leaks Instrument that a leaked block turns up as __NSMallocBlock.  However, when using the Allocations Instrument a search for __NSMallocBlock does not show up.Any ideas what to look for in the Allocations Instrument to track Objective-C blocks?Many Thanks",ios

I am trying to include it in a list of output (extracting the relevant bits here so that you don't have to read through the entire list of fields).componentDidMount() {    this.setState({ loading: true });    this.unsubscribe = this.props.firebase      .users()      .onSnapshot(snapshot =&gt; {        let users = [];        snapshot.forEach(doc =&gt;          users.push({ ...doc.data(), uid: doc.id }),        );        this.setState({          users,          loading: false,        });      });  }  componentWillUnmount() {    this.unsubscribe();  }  render() {    const { users, loading } = this.state;    return (        &lt;div&gt;    {loading &amp;&amp; &lt;div&gt;Loading ...&lt;/div&gt;}            {users.map(user =&gt; (                &lt;Paragraph key={user.uid}&gt;         &lt;key={user.uid}&gt;         {user.email}       {user.name}       {user.createdAt.toDate()}       {user.createdAt.toDate}       {user.createdAt.toDate()).toDateString()}The only attribute that won't render is the date.Each of the above attempts generates an error that says:   TypeError: Cannot read property 'toDate' of undefinedI have seen this post, and this post and this post, and this post and others like them, which suggest that toDate() should work. But - this extension throws an error for me - including when I try the toString extension.I know it knows there is something in firestore because when I try user.createdAt, I get an error saying it found an object with seconds in it.Taking the example from Waelmas below, I tried to log the output of the field as:this.db.collection('users').doc('HnH5TeCU1lUjeTqAYJ34ycjt78w22').get().then(function(doc) {  console.log(doc.data().createdAt.toDate());}I also tried adding this to my map statement but get an error that says user.get is not a function.{user.get().then(function(doc) {                    console.log(doc.data().createdAt.toDate());}                  )}It generates the same error message as above.NEXT ATTEMPTOne strange thing that has come up in trying to find a way to record a date in Firestore that allows me to then read it back, is that when I change my submit handler in one form to use this formulation:handleCreate = (event) =&gt; {    const { form } = this.formRef.props;    form.validateFields((err, values) =&gt; {      if (err) {        return;      };    const payload = {    name: values.name,    // createdAt: this.fieldValue.Timestamp()    // createdAt: this.props.firebase.fieldValue.serverTimestamp()    }    console.log(""formvalues"", payload);    // console.log(_firebase.fieldValue.serverTimestamp());    this.props.firebase    .doCreateUserWithEmailAndPassword(values.email, values.password)    .then(authUser =&gt; {    return this.props.firebase.user(authUser.user.uid).set(        {          name: values.name,          email: values.email,          createdAt: new Date()          // .toISOString()          // createdAt: this.props.firebase.fieldValue.serverTimestamp()        },        { merge: true },    );    // console.log(this.props.firebase.fieldValue.serverTimestamp())    })    .then(() =&gt; {      return this.props.firebase.doSendEmailVerification();      })    // .then(() =&gt; {message.success(""Success"") })    .then(() =&gt; {      this.setState({ ...initialValues });      this.props.history.push(ROUTES.DASHBOARD);    })  });  event.preventDefault();    };That works to record a date in the database.The form of the firestore entry looks like this:I'm trying to display a date in this component:class UserList extends Component {  constructor(props) {    super(props);    this.state = {      loading: false,      users: [],    };  }  componentDidMount() {    this.setState({ loading: true });    this.unsubscribe = this.props.firebase      .users()      .onSnapshot(snapshot =&gt; {        let users = [];        snapshot.forEach(doc =&gt;          users.push({ ...doc.data(), uid: doc.id }),        );        this.setState({          users,          loading: false,        });      });  }  componentWillUnmount() {    this.unsubscribe();  }  render() {    const { users, loading } = this.state;    return (      &lt;div&gt;          {loading &amp;&amp; &lt;div&gt;Loading ...&lt;/div&gt;}          &lt;List            itemLayout=""horizontal""            dataSource={users}            renderItem={item =&gt; (              &lt;List.Item key={item.uid}&gt;                &lt;List.Item.Meta                  title={item.name}                  description={item.organisation}                /&gt;                  {item.email}                  {item.createdAt}                  {item.createdAt.toDate()}                  {item.createdAt.toDate().toISOString()}              &lt;/List.Item&gt;            // )          )}          /&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;    );  }}export default withFirebase(UserList);When I try to read it back - using:{item.email}The error message reads:                   Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found:  Timestamp(seconds=1576363035, nanoseconds=52000000)). If you meant to  render a collection of children, use an array instead.      in Item (at UserIndex.jsx:74)When I try using each of these attempts:{item.createdAt}{item.createdAt.toDate()}{item.createdAt.toDate().toISOString()}I get an error that says:  TypeError: Cannot read property 'toDate' of undefinedBased on the ability to read back entries logged in the same document in other fields, I'm expecting any of these to work to produce output -even if it's not formatted in the way I want. That doesn't happen.NEXT ATTEMPTTaking Waelmas' example, I tried to follow the instructions, but where we aren't getting the same response is in the first step. Where Walemas gets an output based on the .toDate() extension, I get an error saying toDate() is not a function.Consistent with the Firebase documentation, I tried:    const docRef = this.props.firebase.db.collection(""users"").doc(""HnH5TeCU1lUjeTqAYJ34ycjt78w22"");docRef.get().then(function(docRef) {    if (doc.exists) {        console.log(""Document createdAt:"", docRef.createdAt.toDate());}})This produces a string of errors with the syntax and I can't find a way around them.NEXT ATTEMPTI then tried making a new form to see if I could explore this without the authentication aspect of the users form.I have a form that takes input as:this.props.firebase.db.collection(""insights"").add({            title: title,            text: text,            // createdAt1: new Date(),            createdAt: this.props.firebase.fieldValue.serverTimestamp()        })Where in the previous form, the new Date() attempt worked to record a date in the database, in this example both fields for createdAt and createdAt1 generate the same database entry:&lt;div&gt;{item.createdAt.toDate()}&lt;/div&gt;                    &lt;div&gt;{item.createdAt.toDate()}&lt;/div&gt;When I try to output the value of the dates, the first one generates an error that says:  Objects are not valid as a React child (found: Sun Dec 15 2019  21:33:32 GMT+1100 (Australian Eastern Daylight Time)). If you meant to  render a collection of children, use an array insteadThe second generates the error saying:  TypeError: Cannot read property 'toDate' of undefinedI'm stuck for ideas on what to try next.I saw this post that suggests that the following might do something useful:                {item.createdAt1.Date.valueOf()}It doesn't. It renders an error that says:   TypeError: Cannot read property 'Date' of undefinedThis post seems to be having the same trouble as me, but doesn't go into how they managed to display the date value they stored.This post seems to be getting stuck at the array error message, but seems to have figured out how to display a date using createdAt.toDate()",javascript

46480," loading performance I imagine a popular use case for &lt;script type=""module""&gt; will be for loading a ""main module,"" from which all of a project's dependencies are resolved through a tree of import statements. However, on the web, it seems like this would create a loading bottleneck, as the browser could not know which scripts to download until it parsed their dependents for import. Contrast this to a situation where all of a project's scripts are referenced in separate &lt;script&gt; elements in the initially-delivered HTML file. The scripts could all download in parallel, while and after the HTML is parsed.Will &lt;script type=""module""&gt; create a loading bottleneck? Can multiple &lt;script type=""module""&gt; elements on a page provide dependencies for each other, so the browser doesn't necessarily need to download and parse JavaScript to figure out what to download next?I suppose this would be a use case for HTTP/2 PUSH_PROMISE? The server would need to statically analyze the JavaScript files and determine their dependencies ahead of time. But even if the browser could be told to download the modules early, I wonder if the pushed modules would still not execute until import was parsed. At least with &lt;script&gt;, I know they would execute at the first opportunity.",javascript

How do these applications get so much detail about battery health when [UIDevice] provides so little information about it and almost no information on battery health and performance. ",ios
24367,"parser.parse() in Swift leads to EXC_BAD_ACCESS I'm following this tutorial as a jump start for an RSS feeder app I'm working on in Swift. I know there are some things that have changed in Swift since this tutorial, but none of them seem to explain why I'm having this issue.Relevant Code (as far as I can tell) is as follows in my TableViewController:  override func viewDidLoad() {    super.viewDidLoad()    let url:NSURL = NSURL(string: ""my.url.string"")    parser = NSXMLParser(contentsOfURL: url)    parser.delegate = self    parser.parse() // &lt;- Thread 1: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=1, address=0x0)}There doesn't seem to be a problem with the actual parser delegate methods as I put breakpoints on them and they aren't even being called before the crash.My assumption is that it's a Swift bug, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something before I go complaining to apple about it.",ios

9459,"How to interpolate hue values in HSV colour space? I'm trying to interpolate between two colours in HSV colour space to produce a smooth colour gradient.I'm using a linear interpolation, eg:h = (1 - p) * h1 + p * h2s = (1 - p) * s1 + p * s2v = (1 - p) * v1 + p * v2(where p is the percentage, and h1, h2, s1, s2, v1, v2 are the hue, saturation and value components of the two colours)This produces a good result for s and v but not for h. As the hue component is an angle, the calculation needs to work out the shortest distance between h1 and h2 and then do the interpolation in the right direction (either clockwise or anti-clockwise).What formula or algorithm should I use?

I've tried to log the description variable to make sure it's going inside the if case. Therefore, I assumed the form was never submitting, and the whole 'submission' is done via Ajax, on the button click.Approach #2The functions.php remains the same as approach #1, but I've made some changes Javascript wise to target the button click event instead of the form submit event.require_category_description.php&lt;script&gt;    jQuery(document).ready(function(){        var description = jQuery('#tag-description');        if(!description) description = jQuery('#description');        if(description){            var button = description.parents('form').find('#submit');            button.on('click', function(e){                if(description.val().trim().length &lt; 1)                    console.log('Please enter a description...');                e.preventDefault();                return false;            });        }    });&lt;/script&gt;The form is however still submitting, but this time, I see the console log message.

Something like res.json({fileName: fileName}); res.end();I really don't know at this point, and all the tutorials I can find on multer just show how to create a new filename and save a file in disk or database or memory, but nowhere does it show how you can actually get that filename back to the application that uploaded it.Thank you in advance for any help, I really appreciate it. If you need to see the ionic 2 code that uploads the stuff please let me know and I will update the post with that code as well. Thank you.",javascript

17757,"Tracking video milestones from a custom HTML5 video player to Omniture Media Module? I've got a mobile Javascript application that occasionally dynamically-creates a &lt;video&gt; element on the screen. I need to track video plays with Omniture. I have bound the play, pause, ended, seeking and seeked events to track that the user started a video, paused, resumed, and stopped (or that they completed viewing the video). This is all implemented with calls likes.Media.play(""some_video_name"", timePosition);ands.Media.stop(""some_video_name"");Etc. This all currently works.What I want to now do is track the positional milestones of 0, 25, 75, and 100%, with the trackMilestones option, but I don't understand how any of the examples I've found online actually inform the Omniture s.Media object of where they are. Omniture wouldn't be able to magically know where my video is unless it attaches event handlers to my video element. Is that what they're doing? Is there some method I can call on the s.Media object to inform it of my position as my player is playing video?",javascript

I use an AVCaptureSession which is constantly returning CMSampleBufferRef's (found here).I'm not so sure yet what I need to do with the CMSampleBufferRef. I do know how to transform it into a CGImage or a UIImage (thanks to Benjamin Loulier's great blogpost2), but I have no idea of what specifically I need to send and if I need to encode the frames somehow.As mentioned by @jab in the above linked answer (this) it is possible to write those samples to a file with one or more AVAssetWriter's. But then again he says those 5 sec video snippets are to be uploaded to a server which makes a streamable movie file out of them (and that movie can then be streamed to an iOS device by HTTP Live Streaming I suppose).As I already indicated, my app (i.e. the video capturing ""server"" device) has one or multiple clients connected to it and needs to send the video frames in real time to them. One idea which came to my mind is to use a simple TCP connection where the server sends every single frame in a serialised format to the connected clients in a loop. More specifically: when one buffered frame is successfully sent to the client, the server takes the most recent frame as the next one to be sent.Now: is this the right thought how it should work? Or is there another protocol, which is much better suited for this kind of task? Remember: I want to keep it simple (simple for me, i.e., so that I don't need to study too many new programming aspects) and fast. I already know some things about TCP, I wrote servers and clients with it at school in C, so I'd prefer to apply the knowledge I have now to this project...Last but not least, the receiving client:I imagine, if I'm really going to use a TCP connection, that on the client-side I receive frame after frame from the server, cast the read byte package into the used format (CMSampleBuffer, CGImage, UIImage) and just display it on a CALayer or UIImageView, right? The effect of a movie will be gotten by just constantly keeping updated that image view.Please give me some ideas on how to reach this goal. It is very important, because it's part of my school-graduation project... Any sample code is also appreciated ;-) Or just refer me to another site, tutorial, Stackoverflow-answer, etc.If you have any question to this, just leave a comment and I'll update the post.",ios

Might be confusing because they have the same color.) Then the third label with the small black text.The first label resized itself correctly with no problem and the second label moves up and down accordingly. But the problem is with the third small label. As you can see, its not resizing itself to fit all the text.Now there's a weird thing happening. I turn it landscape and here's it is.Since there is space the label is displaying the entire text its supposed to. Fine. Then I turn it back to portrait.Now the small label has resized itself to fit all its text but it overflows the cells boundaries. I tried making the cell bigger but it didn't work. Since this is self sizing cells, I don't think that's the correct way even.I'm not getting any errors or even warning on my auto layout constraints either.I have set these two lines of code in the viewDidLoad() method.tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 100tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimensionCan anyone please tell me what I might be doing wrong here?Since its difficult to answer just by looking at images and I don't have any more code to post beside the above snippet, I uploaded a runnable Xcode project demonstrating the issue here.

According to it, each subview should have constraints that pin  all its sides and there should be constraints that goes from top to  bottom which helps auto layout to calculate the height of the cell. In my original post, I had vertical spaces between each label so I think that's the reason auto layout couldn't calculate the proper height.So I made some changes.I reduced the vertical space between labels to 0 and set the Vertical space constraints between top and middle labels and middle and bottom labels.I added leading, top, trailing constraints to the top label.Leading and trailing to the middle label.Leading, bottom, trailing to the bottom label.Now here's another weird part. When I first run it, the bottom label cropping issue is still there.But if I rotate the device to landscape and turn it back to portrait, all the all the cells are resized properly to fit both labels!Still can't figure out why this doesn't happen at first though.

25486,"How to create basic TypeScript project using jQuery, RequireJS, and KnockoutJS I have been searching for a simple how-to, to create the most basic example of a Visual Studio 2012 TypeScript project utilizing RequireJS, jQuery, and KnockoutJS.  There are several examples available, but for me some where more complicated than I wanted so I set out to create a how-to, and have posted it here for public scrutiny.  I have answered my own question as a Q&amp;A style knowledge sharing exercise.For those unfamiliar, here is a quick breakdown of the included components...TypeScript - A Visual Studio extension that allows scripting to create a .TS file via a language that is a superset of JavaScript.  This provides the ability to define a data type associated with methods and variables - which is otherwise missing from JavaScript.  By doing so, compile time checks can ensure the proper use in an attempt to reduce run-time conflicts.  When building the Visual Studio project, the Visual Studio extension will compile the script into actual JavaScript.  As such, this extension comes with it's own compiler - tsc.exe.  It is expected the resulting JavaScript files will be deployed to production, not the source code .ts files.jQuery - a JavaScript framework for HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax interaction.RequireJS - Dependency loader.  Sometimes JavaScript references can get crazy.  This attempts to assist with these concerns.  My example shows that even though many JavaScript files are in use, the HTML only refers to one - the root JavaScript file that loads the others.KnockoutJS - UI binding, utilizing the MVVM pattern.  HTML views refer to variables and methods in a view-model.  The view model is a JavaScript object (the JavaScript file is likely the result of compiling a .ts file - see TypeScript above).DefinitelyTyped - Also included are two DefinitelyTyped NuGet packages.  Because TypeScript is attempting to verify data type usage, it is performing a check to ensure it is aware of all references.  JavaScript is a bit more loose than that.  In order to satisfy TypeScript (when referring to external JavaScript objects) we need a way to describe (to TypeScript) the objects we expect to be used.  These DefinitelyTyped scripts provide this definition.  They provide no functionality, just clarity to the TypeScript compiler so it can perform these checks.In the example below, you will see /// &lt;reference path=""../Scripts/typings/requirejs/require.d.ts"" /&gt;This is how the TypeScript compiler will include the requirejs DefinitelyTyped definition file.  The organization creating these DefinitelyTyped scripts have created a vast collection.  Here we refer to only two - KnockoutJS, and RequireJS (well, because that is the scope of this tutorial)",javascript

23800,"Why content insets of a UITableView inside a UIPageViewController get messy right after an interaction? I've created a Page-Based Application and hacked it a bit for some experiments; my simple aim is to have a UIPageViewController whose pages will contain a UIViewController holding a UITableView (after further inspection, the outcome of my experiment is the same if I use a UITableViewController instead).To do this I've simply edited the project template, and added the UIPageViewController as an embedded view of the RootViewController using Storyboard's ContainerView object, as you can see in this screenshot:Every controller is configured via storyboard to automatically adjust scroll view's content inset, and if I start the project with this configuration everything looks fine, and the DataViewController's tableview has its content insets properly adjusted right under the navigation bar as expected; however, as the user makes an interaction with the tableview, the content insets break and the tableview underlaps the navigation bar:I have been able to fix this by manually setting the content insets in DataViewController's viewDidLayoutSubview method, and by disabling Adjusts Scroll View Insets on any controller, so I don't need this as an answer to solve my problem.My question is why the content insets are properly set right after the first controller gets loaded from the storyboard the first time, and why they break after any kind of user interaction.If you need to test it directly, here's a link to the project",ios

35632,"Properly disposing of browser resources I have a web application which dynamically loads in data over a long period of time. Within the data there are links to images which are then rendered in the browser.e.g.var object = {     Name: ko.observable(""Foo""),     Ref: ko.observable(""Bar""),     ImageUrl: ko.observable(""http://....."")           }I am using Knockoutjs 's template binding to render the data on the screen.&lt;img data-bind=""attr: { src: imageUrl }"" /&gt;         So every time the object changes via an Ajax call, the Knockoutjs template is re-rendered with the data, and the images change.After a long period of time, these images build up and will eat up more memory. Modern browsers seem to cope better, but the problem is mainly with IE8 (we do not support &lt; IE8). Even in modern browsers the memory will eventually get so high that the browser freezes.See this screen shot for an example of the image resources building up.I decided to see what would happen if instead of using an &lt;img /&gt; tag, use a &lt;iframe /&gt;.So my code now looks like&lt;iframe data-bind=""attr: { src: imageUrl }""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;What happens now is that the frame is created, but as soon as the imageUrl changes, the frame simply updates and does not create additional resources.So if I want to keep the browser memory usage down, I can use this &lt;iframe /&gt; technique, but I don't like it. It forces me to make many other changes to the application, plus I need to use iframes!I have run various tests now to see how much memory is used up using both techniques, and over the same period of time the memory will increase from 81,000k to 200,000k (with &lt;img /&gt;) compared to 81,000k to 98,000k ( with &lt;iframe /&gt;)QuestionIs there a better way to manage image resources within a browser?

21738,"Can Webkit JavaScript PUT or POST an image REST-style as pure binary? When my browser downloads an image from a web site, there is no base64 encoding involved. It issues an HTTP command like GET /image.jpg and receives an HTTP response whose Content-Type is something like image/jpg, whose Content-Length is the number of bytes in the image, and whose body is the raw binary image data itself. The data is neither encoded using a character set, nor encoded using a scheme like base64.Writing RESTful resources has trained me to expect symmetry between HTTP GET and PUT so that, for example, a URL that delivers JSON data when I do a GET will then accept JSON data when it is presented with a PUT. In neither case is form encoding involved; in both cases there is simply a Content-Length giving the number of bytes in the payload, a Content-Type header declaring that the payload is JSON in some character set, and then the character data sits alone and unadorned as the body of the GET or PUT.I am writing a PhoneGap application that lets users take photographs and them upload them using my application. I had expected that I could design a RESTful interface for this, that supports symmetric GET and PUT — so that PUT commands involve no special encoding, nor involve any idea of a character set, but simply have a Content-Type of image/jpg and then a mass of binary JPG data as their payload. Obviously this is a more efficient use of bandwidth than trying to encode the image inside of a form. And this approach works fine when I PUT to a URL using a tool like curl.But I am having no luck in doing a clean RESTful PUT from PhoneGap WebKit JavaScript! PhoneGap is willing to return the image to my JavaScript as either a local file: URL, or else as a data: URL that carries the image data inline courtesy of base64 encoding. But in neither case can I find a clear way to convert the image into a pure binary format (would I use one of those newfangled Blob objects for this? if so, how?) and then cause a PUT that, without festooning the request with extra layers of form or encoding cruft, will simply transmit the raw image across the wire to my web server as the HTTP request payload.Does anyone know how to induce WebKit to PUT an AJAX request with a raw image as its body?

38494,"Signalr deserializes my objects incorrectly in IIS 7.5 and Edge/IE, foreverFrame broken? So I have a simple Signalr/Knockout project that uses the mapping plugin to bind  a simple object (item with an array of more items) to viewModels I defined in JS: var someObjectMapping = {    'MyItemArray': {        create: function (options) {            return new MyItemViewModel(options.data);        }    }}var myItemMapping = {    'ItemChildren': {        create: function (options) {            return new ItemChildViewModel(options.data);        }    }}var SomeObjectViewModel = function (data) {    ko.mapping.fromJS(data, someObjectMapping, this);}var MyItemViewModel = function (data) {    ko.mapping.fromJS(data, myItemMapping, this);}var ItemChildViewModel = function (data) {    ko.mapping.fromJS(data, null, this);}I use SignalR's default settings to connect to my hub like so:    var myHubProxy = $.connection.myHub;    myHubProxy.client.processSomeObject = function(someObject) {        console.log('SomeObject received');        var viewModel = new SomeObjectViewModel(someObject);        ko.applyBindings(viewModel);    }    $.connection.hub.start().done(function() {        console.log('Now connected, connection ID=' + $.connection.hub.id);        myHubProxy.server.getSomeObject();    });When my object comes back, knockout applies the binding and the mapping gets processed. Then the object and its child arrays are naturally rendered on the page:&lt;h2 data-bind=""text: MyItem""&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul data-bind=""foreach: MyItemArray""&gt;    &lt;li&gt;        &lt;span data-bind=""text: Name""&gt;&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;ul data-bind=""foreach: ItemChildren""&gt;            &lt;li data-bind=""text: Name""&gt;&lt;/li&gt;        &lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Now for the kicker: This works in on my local machine (Win 10, IIS Express), in all browsers (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/IE), no problem. When I publish this to IIS 7.5 however, it works in all browsers except for Internet Explorer 8-10 and Microsoft Edge. Same code.When I drill through F12 I notice that, from IIS, the create function in the first mapping gets an array:When instead, on first break, I should have the first item in my array like it does on my local machine:Drilling up the callstack reveals that the parent object in knockout.mapping's createCallback function is not being interpreted as an array as it should:However, on my local machine, it works as expected:Strangely, one of two things can workaround the issue: First, if I serialize the object I get back from SignalR and then deseralize it before binding it my knockout model, everything works from all browsers from IIS 7.5:  myHubProxy.client.processSomeObject = function(someObject) {        console.log('SomeObject received');        var jsonStr = JSON.stringify(someObject);        var viewModel = new SomeObjectViewModel(JSON.parse(jsonStr));        ko.applyBindings(viewModel);    }But this can affect performance.OR if I force SignalR's transport to longPolling, again everything works in all browsers from IIS 7.5:    $.connection.hub.start({ transport: ""longPolling"" }).done(function () {        console.log('Now connected, connection ID=' + $.connection.hub.id);        myHubProxy.server.getSomeObject();    });But then I wouldn't have the advantages WebSockets provides over polling.IIS 7.5 doesn't support WebSocketsI can also hardcode my json and bind it with knockout, which works as expected in all browsers.It took me forever to discover what was going on, and I've been struggling to figure this one out. It's strange that this works from IIS 7.5 in all the other browsers but IE/Edge when they're running the same simple script. It also works with in all browsers IIS 10 (non-Express), which isn't an option for the server I'm publishing to.Edit: Uffe has pointed out that IIS 7.5 doesn't support WebSockets. After enabling logging, I saw that, for IIS 7.5, Signalr will instead fallback to foreverFrame for IE and serverSentEvents (which isn't supported in IE) for other browsers. I also tested forcing foreverFrame, which reproduced the issue on my machine with IIS 10 Express:     $.connection.hub.start({ transport: 'foreverFrame'}).done(function () {        console.log('Now connected, connection ID=' + $.connection.hub.id);        myHubProxy.server.getSomeObject();    });So another workaround would be to skip foreverFrame from the transport altogether when publishing to IIS 7.5 like so:    $.connection.hub.start({ transport: ['serverSentEvents','longPolling']}).done(function () {        console.log('Now connected, connection ID=' + $.connection.hub.id);        myHubProxy.server.getSomeObject();    });Here's a sample project which reproduces the issue: https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=D4E23CA0ED671323!1466815&amp;authkey=!AEAEBajrZx3y8e4&amp;ithint=folder%2csln",asp.net

We'd like to give the user the option to attach this file to an email instead, and we're having trouble using the Stream object and Attachment logic together.We start with ABCpdf, which has two save methods: it can save to a Stream, or if you give it a string, it'll try to save to a file on the disk there.  We've done both no problem.Stream stream = new MemoryStream();myPdf.Save(stream);Everything is mostly cool at this point - stream has several kilobytes of data, and if you .Save() to a file, you get an actual file with the same number of bytes.So we attach to an email at this point (after initializing the mail object, setting To: and From:, etc.):mail.Attachments.Add(new Attachment(stream, ""myPdf.pdf""));mail.Send();...which gets us as far as receiving an email with 0 bytes, but the proper filename.

28614,"iOS 7 - NSURLSession Resumable Uploads I'm currently in the process of designing a system for uploading multiple images to a server from an application. The files will be stored on the local device and the current idea is to split them into chunks and then upload them chunk-by-chunk to the server, waiting for a success message back before uploading the next one.This process should be seamless for the user, they should press a button to submit all images and then be able to close the application and for it to continue in the background. With iOS 7 I have seen that you can pass your uploads to the new NSURLSession API and have it deal with the upload task independent from your application.I was wondering if anyone knows how reliable this transfer is. If I pass it an entire image, what happens if internet connection drops half way through? Does the background transfer service retry at a later time? The idea is that we can upload an image, and if it fails half way through that we can simply continue from that point later on when connection is resumed. One idea we had was to split the files into chunks and then pass all the chunks as separate NSURLSessionUploadTasks and just assume that they'll all be sent to the server eventually.Another was to send the first chunk using: uploadTaskWithRequest:fromData:completionHandler:And then in the completitionHandler to then send the next chunk. My issue with this is that if in the background the next chunk will have its@property BOOL discretionary = truewhich means that it will only send over WiFi when plugged in. I need this to work over all networks and be able to cope with interuptions.I don't want any code,  just advice on if this is the correct way to go about achieving this.",ios

15597,"What is the most secure way of passing messages between an injected script and Google Chrome extension code/content script? Definitions: Please note from the outset that by 'injected script', 'extension code' and 'content script' I will be using the definitions provided in the excellent first answer to this question. Assumption: Handling confidential information is less secure if I do it directly within my injected script (in the web zone) than if I do it within the chrome:// zone of content scripts and extension code. I therefore should use message passing to send confidential information from the web zone to the chrome:// zone for it to be handled.Question: I'm building a Google Chrome extension where I need to run some operations on sensitive user data derived from my injected script. The data in question is confidential and I must do all I can to ensure that it can't be seen by anyone but the user of the extension until I've operated on it. Of the 3 techniques (defined below) that can be used to pass messages between an injected script and extension code/content script which would be best for this purpose? My understanding of the 3 different techniques that can be used for passing data between an injected script and extension code/content script:For messaging passing between an injected script and extension code (e.g. a background page), one can use the chrome.runtime API. For messaging passing between an injected script and a content script one can use window.postMessage.Another way of passing messages between an injected script and a content script is via document.dispatchEvent(CustomEvent).My understanding is that method 1. cannot be used for message passing between an injected script and a content script while methods 2. and 3. cannot be used for message passing between an injected script and extension code (unless the message is forwarded by the content script to, for example, a background page).",javascript

45519,"How to render clipped surfaces as solid objects In Three.js, I have a 3d object where I am using local clipping planes to only render a part of the object.However, since 3d objects are ""hollow"" (meaning only the outer surface is rendered), when we clip anything off that surface we can ""see into"" the object. Here's an example of what I mean, clipping a corner off a cube. Notice how we can see the backside of the opposite corner.I would like to give the appearance of the object being solid. Based on this issue, it seems that the best way to accomplish this is to create a surface over the clipped region, thus capping the hole and making the object appear like it isn't hollow.My question is, how do I know where to build this surface?

No problem, right?But where do I add it? view.superview is nil; there is no superview.

38583,"How to intercept 404 using Owin middleware BackgroundFirst let me explain the background. I am working on a project that attempts to marry a backend server that uses Web API configured via OWIN- hosted on IIS now, but potentially other OWIN-supported hosts in the future- to a frontend using AngularJS.The AngularJS frontend is entirely static content. I completely avoid server-side technologies such as MVC/Razor, WebForms, Bundles, anything that has to do with the frontend and the assets it uses, and defer instead to the latest and greatest techniques using Node.js, Grunt/Gulp, etc. to handle CSS compilation, bundling, minification, etc. For reasons I won't go into here, I keep the frontend and server projects in separate locations within the same project (rather than stick them all in the Host project directly (see crude diagram below).MyProject.slnserver  MyProject.Host     MyProject.Host.csproj     Startup.cs     (etc.)frontend  MyProjectApp     app.js     index.html     MyProjectApp.njproj     (etc.)So as far as the frontend is concerned, all I need to do is get my Host to serve my static content. In Express.js, this is trivial. With OWIN, I was able to do this easily using Microsoft.Owin.StaticFiles middleware, and it works great (it's very slick).Here is my OwinStartup configuration:string dir = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.RelativeSearchPath; // get executing pathstring contentPath = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(dir, @""../../../frontend/MyProjectApp"")); // resolve nearby frontend project directoryapp.UseFileServer(new FileServerOptions{    EnableDefaultFiles = true,    FileSystem = new PhysicalFileSystem(contentPath),    RequestPath = new PathString(string.Empty) // starts at the root of the host});// ensure the above occur before map handler to prevent native static content handlerapp.UseStageMarker(PipelineStage.MapHandler);The CatchBasically, it just hosts everything in frontend/MyProjectApp as if it were right inside the root of MyProject.Host. So naturally, if you request a file that doesn't exist, IIS generates a 404 error.Now, because this is an AngularJS app, and it supports html5mode, I will have some routes that aren't physical files on the server, but are handled as routes in the AngularJS app. If a user were to drop onto an AngularJS (anything other than index.html or a file that physically exists, in this example), I would get a 404 even though that route might be valid in the AngularJS app. Therefore, I need my OWIN middleware to return the index.html file in the event a requested file does not exist, and let my AngularJS app figure out if it really is a 404. If you're familiar with SPAs and AngularJS, this is a normal and straight-forward approach. If I were using MVC or ASP.NET routing, I could just set the default route to an MVC controller that returns my index.html, or something along those lines. However, I've already stated I'm not using MVC and I'm trying to keep this as simple and lightweight as possible.This user had a similar dilemma and solved it with IIS rewriting. In my case, it doesn't work because a) my content doesn't physically exist where the rewrite URL module can find it, so it always returns index.html and b) I want something that doesn't rely on IIS, but is handled within OWIN middleware so it can be used flexibly.TL;DNR me, for crying out loud.Simple, how can I intercept a 404 Not Found and return the content of (note: not redirect) my FileServer-served index.html using OWIN middleware?","c#,asp.net"

33912,"How to add a delay before starting a Mocha test case? I'm writing a unit test for my simple Node.js application using Mocha. The application has a class which connects to a Mongo database, fetch the record, and store the formulated record as a field. Simply, the class looks like this:SampleClass.prototype.record = []; // Store the loaded recordSampleClass.prototype.init = function(db){    var self = this;    self.db = mongoose.connection; // Say we already have mongoose object initialized    self.db.once('open',function(){        /* schema &amp; model definitions go here */        var DataModel = mongoose.model( /* foobar */);        DataModel.findOne(function(err,record){           /* error handling goes here */            self.record = record; // Here we fetch &amp; store the data        });    });}As seen from the snippet above, once the SampleClass.init() is called, the Sample.record will not instantly get populated from the database. The data is asynchronously populated once the event 'open' is fired. Thus, there will possibly be a delay after SampleClass.init() until the Sample.record is populated.So it comes into a complication when I write a Mocha test like this:var testSampleClass = new SampleClass();describe('SampleClass init test',function(){    testSampleClass.init('mydb');    it('should have 1 record read from mydb',function(){        assert.equal(testSampleClass.record.length,1);    });});The assertion above will always fail because testSampleClass.record will not get populated straightaway after init. It needs a gap of time to load the data.How can I delay the test case so it starts a few seconds or more after testSampleClass.init is called? Is it also possible to trigger the test case right after an event of my class is fired? Otherwise, this simple case will always fail which I know this is not correct at all.",javascript

7383,"Create XCFramework out of two static libraries (libssl.a, libcrypto.a) Consider OpenSSL, the project itself has two products: libssl.a and libcrypto.a.For the sake of simplicity, let's use the precompiled libraries stored in this repository and consider just iphonesimulator platform.When looking at the repository, each platform, e.g. iphonesimulator or iphoneos will have a set of static libraries for all of the architectures needed.My goal is to create an XCFramework that bundles those two static libraries, so that it would be convenient to use with Swift Package Manager as a single package.I definitely can create an XCFramework supporting multiple platforms: iOS Simulator (i386, x86_64, arm64), iOS (arm64, arm7...) from static libraries with the following command:xcodebuild -create-xcframework \-library iphonesimulator/lib/libcrypto.a \-headers iphonesimulator/include/ \-library iphoneos/lib/libcrypto.a \-headers iphoneos/include/ \-output OpenSSL.xcframeworkThe output is as follows:xcframework successfully written out to:/Users/name/OSSL_test/OpenSSL.xcframeworkThe structure of the framework is correct and it contains both headers and the libcrypto.a. When imported into another Xcode project, this XCFramework is recognized and used in building an app.However, when I also try to add libssl.a, I get the following error:xcodebuild -create-xcframework \-library iphonesimulator/lib/libcrypto.a \-headers iphonesimulator/include/ \-library iphonesimulator/lib/libssl.a \-headers iphonesimulator/include/ \-output OpenSSL.xcframeworkA library with the identifier &quot;ios-arm64_i386_x86_64-simulator&quot;already exists.Which makes sense, since both libcrypto.a and libssl.a are of the same architecture.So, my question is, is it possible to bundle two static libraries together using a single XCFramework? Or should I create two separate XCFrameworks, so that each library has it's own?In the repository mentioned above, the static library actually used in another build phase as inputs producing a .framework per each platform. The build logic is in the OpenSSL.xcodeproj. So, I assume, what I'm asking is simply not possible?",ios

30295,"Sharing images/videos to other apps through UIActivityViewController shows shared items twice in iOS I'm trying to share some images and videos to other apps(like FB, WhatsApp) using UIActivityViewController. I have sub-classed UIActivityItemProvider, and on calling -(id)item methods, I'm processing the images/videos and saving in documents directory. Then I am returning the file paths as NSURLs. My problem is that I'm not able to find a way to send multiple file URLs at the same time.Below are the approaches I took to return urls from -(id)item method;As an NSArray of NSURL objects. DOES NOT WORK. When the target app popup comes, it is empty always.As a NSDictionary, in which NSURL objects are the values and keys could be anything. PROBLEMATIC: The target app popup shows all items, but TWICE! I experimented with the dictionary a lot, but couldn't find a way to solve this.Simply returning an NSURL object from -(id)item method works fine for single file. But, I have to share multiple items. Array doesn't work, Dictionary is duplicating shared items.Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong here?UPDATE 1:This is how I show the UIActivityViewController.CustomItemProvider *provider = [[CustomItemProvider alloc] initWithPlaceholderItem:[UIImage imageNamed:@""ios-59.png""]];UIActivityViewController *activityViewController = [[UIActivityViewController alloc] initWithActivityItems:@[provider] applicationActivities:nil];activityViewController.completionWithItemsHandler = ^(NSString *activityType, BOOL completed, NSArray *returnedItems, NSError *activityError){    if(completed)    {        NSLog(@""Activity Completed"");    }    else    {        NSLog(@""Activity Cancelled"");    }};[self presentViewController:activityViewController animated:YES completion:^{}];The UIActivityItemProvider implementation is as given below; The URLs are valid and there are images/videos at those locations.@interface CustomItemProvider : UIActivityItemProvider@end@implementation CustomItemProvider- (id)item{     NSURL *url1 = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@""file one url""];     NSURL *url2 = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@""file two url""];     NSURL *url3 = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:@""file three url""];     return @{@""item1"":url1, @""item2"":url2, @""item3"":url3};    //As NSDictionary. This causes 6 items to be shared; all files twice.     //return @[url1, url2, url3];  //As NSArray}@endUPDATE 2:The linked question is different.I don't want to send the files directly to the UIActivityViewController as parameter to initWithActivityItems:. The reason is that there could be multiple video files, which will cause memory warning and a crash. Also, I will be manipulating the files before sending it to target app(in the -(id)item method, which I have not shown here), hence I need UIActivityItemProvider to process the files in background.",ios
4424,"PhoneGap Build Plugins not functioning I am building a PhoneGap Build app and I will be requiring some plugins. I have followed the docs yet none are working.

Here's some more:// This is for the clipboard plugin  function handleCopyAndPaste() {      $(&quot;.copyButton&quot;).click(function() {          window.plugins.clipboard.copy($(&quot;#result&quot;).val());      });      $(&quot;.pasteButton&quot;).click(function() {          window.plugins.clipboard.paste(function (text) {               $(&quot;#convertThis&quot;).val(text);              convert();          });      });  } This is for vibrations:navigator.notification.vibrate(2500);This is for hiding the keyboard toolbar once an input field called #convertThis has focus():$(&quot;#convertThis&quot;).focus(function() {    toolbar.hide()});I tried removing the js links in index.html yet still nothing. I also tried putting the plugin tags outside the widget tag in config.xml and... NOTHING! Weirdly enough, the plugins tab in PhoneGap Build dashboards says none are installed:(source: uzusoft.com)If you can provide any help on the matter, please do!
